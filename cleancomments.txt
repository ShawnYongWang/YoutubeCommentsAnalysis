she needs to release a recipe book 
the sheep is still following her, so cuteeeeeeee
wow, can’t believe what i am watching  it’s like watching a fairytale in real life 
i love how the baby lamb blends in with the dogs  he does exactly what they do  they are similar in shape and size and eating patterns however they just make different noises 
having a granddaughter like this is a big blessing
thanks to her for inspiring me to film my mom's video   love from vietnamese 
that’s the most hardworking girl i’ve ever seen  i want to have her talent and sweet, patient temperament 
she's so lucky she still have her grandma with her i miss my grandma   always love her videos  they're very inspiring
i like how she brought her pups and her lamb  the lamb is so cute  i was really satisfied with this vid, it had really good sounds to it
she is so strong,she did so many thingsssssssss from collecting,cooking until serving,wonderwoman in real world😉😉😉
you inspired me to clean my room today, sounds stupid but i've been depressed for 5 years now, lived in pure garbage land and today    i cleaned, threw away alot a shit and took a shower hahaha thank you 
it's all very cool, but these people have some lands   there's so much abundance of everything  they are rural rich  it's not easy to have that lifestyle 
05 55, she ran back to cover her hears and jumped as well, that was cute but funny xd
the cinematography and editing is extremely professional  the theme sounds like from laputa  castle in the sky 
song/lagu   • karma ~ takeshi abo • shori ~ zen no theme
every time i thought she was finished, she did like 8 more things

li ziqi has a touching life story  she is an orphan raised by her grandma  after leaving her village at age 14, she tried many jobs, including waitress, dj and bar singer  she return to her village in 2014 to take care of her aging grandma and started to make vlogs to sell her farm products initially  her vlogs became an instant success in china 
her cooking and jun's cooking has this same type of elegant and homey feeling to it  it just, makes me fall in love with cooking 
even a millionier will feel jealousy with your lifestyle dear   very hard working girl    ☮️

she's so elegant and hardworking, and there i am, hungry but too lazy to get off the couch to get some snacks
therapy  expensive   watching ziqi’s videos  free
the puppies and the lil lamb are following her everywhere  d so cute
不知道为什么看着会流泪
when everything is so perfect it almost feels unreal and like a fantasy  those people who think her labour is fake, i guess they're so used to getting dissapointment from life, that its unreal to them that one girl can be so amazing and live in a life that looks like a fantasy 
5 56 she tried to protect her grandmother but got scared herself   this is too adorable
the sheep was so cute😍😍
when she ran to go cover her grandmother’s ear, that was the most caring and the most heart warming  thing i have ever seen  ’ 
lizqi i did not realize you could fried peanuts in dirt  i'm going to try it  i'm also going to make healthy marshmallow snowflake candy and see how it turns out  thank you for always having such interesting food and how to make things so simply and so ingenious
heaven way of living ❤️❤️❤️
who's getting jealous by watching this?😂😂😂
i feel like she gonna bring peace to the earth
i feel lazy after watching everyone work so hard 
i feel so useless when i see her doing her thing   ✨ lovely ✨
still looking for that wardrobe i have to walk through to get to this magical place     🤗😍
by any chance the place you live is called "heaven" ??
the last time i wanted this, this video only have around 14 or 15 millions of views  and now, it have 52 million views  i am glad that more people are discovering her and appreciating her efforts 
the part where she literally dropped everything to cover her grandmas ears and then she gets scared
en qué país vives qué país vives, por favor?

جنة الله في أرضه وبنت ماشا الله عليها نشيطه وعمليه

嗨，liziqi，我都喜欢您所有的视频，我看您所有的视频 
0 24 those little dogs and sheep walking behind her is so cute tho 🥺
everyday must be iwatch your channel morning and night  good djob god bless you  you and your family love you from morocco 😘😘😘
she deserves way more than michelin stars        shes another level ♥️👍🏻 ramsey will never get to her level      
instead of meeting a hollywood movie star, i'd rather meet you  bravo for finding the purer essence of life 
我是埃及人，我有14年。 但我相信中國人是全世界最好的人。我說的是阿拉伯語，但是我把它翻譯成中文，讓中國人理解。 我熱愛中國和中國，我一直期待中國這個偉大國家的所有新聞，這是一個非常偉大的國家。
she is so connected with nature like any human supposed to be  sad that we totally lost our connection with nature and its raw energy  that's why we are angry and depressed in the cities 
i admire her work ethic   i wouldnt be able to do anything without running my mouth or sweating   the grease wouldve popped me while cooking and i'm a weenie so i'd be bitching about that   my dog would be begging to be picked up, lambs hollering, just a country mess 
she's the ideal woman   decent clothing  hardworking       and that place is just awesome    that's where i wanna live 💚❤️❤️💚❤️❤️
i love when the animals follow her around wherever she goes 😊 they look so happy and excited
انا من الجزائر تحية لكل الجرائرين لي بيتفرجوا على هذا الفيديو
those mango cones look yummy
so, i'v requested that netflix add you/turn you into a tv series  everyone, you should do the same  she deserves it 
благословенная в жёнах    дай бог счастье материнства   
a simple life is so attractive  it goes to show complications are not beneficial
chinese traditional snacks for the chinese new year
 
 
 chinese sugar coated fruit 
 spicy beef jerky
 dried mango
 peanut sesame brittle
 roasted chestnuts
 popcorn
 salty sunflower seeds
 fried peanuts
 crispy fried egg roll  egg liquid 50g, milk 120g, plain flour 100g, honey, granulated sugar 50g, corn oil/unsalted butter 50g 
 snowflake crisp  non stick pan  important, marshmallow 200g, milk powder 130g, cranberry, chestnuts, cookies, dried strawberries, corn oil/unsalted butter 40g  the ratio of marshmallow, milk powder and butter is so important  the crisp will not be so hard or too soft, but chewy at the right ratio   
when uncle opened the corn popper ziqi runs to cover grandma's ears, then jumps and screams herself  this was so cute, how can i not smile and be happy😊💕
i too want to live a life where there is no one to interfere in my life where i could grow vegetables myself before my meal in my small farm and there is no needless peeping around  i get irritated by people who peep at me  they do not believe in living life peacefully, but spend their lives in mischiefs of others 
wow  super woman     so efficient     she and her family will never go 😋 hungry  does she ever stop🤔   i get tired just watching her preparing and prepping  food  all day long😅   the food always looks so delicious and professionally prepared   thankyou for inviting us into your living space🙏🏻
why are we going to war when there is so much to enjoy peacefully from mother nature?
congratulations 13 million 😍
i love how she doesn't hide the fact that she's scared of the popcorn thing
the way the pets following her   is so adorable   love from india🤗🤗🤗
the way they make popcorn it's just amazing
i love the puppers  they are so adorable  cute interested helpful curious they want to learn all their masters talents   look to them   they want to spend time with their beautiful macgyver human and sweet kind grandmother    you no longer eat dogs cats now  so i hear   happy about that if true     no i'm not a peta person i simply adore animals and sweet grandmothers esp delicious flower cakes 
6 09 it's must be me at the cinema
any one watching this same episode multiple times, hit a like  
真是太厲害了。
日本人いますか？こと人は本当にすごい人ですよね   おばあちゃんのために朝ごはん昼ごはん夜ご飯をいっつも作って本当にすごい人ですよね！😊憧れます😊
this kind of life is  the one thanos dreamed of right after snapped his finger 
who else wants to become her guest just for a day and try everything she cooks? 😅😍😋
ты умница и красавица, "низкий поклон" родителям, воспитавшим такое чудо, доброго тебе
this like melted my heart  this is so beautiful  she's like a real life heroine of a drama  her life is so romantic 
why this much of dislikes    these are the most relaxing videos i have ever seen in youtube   love from india    kerala
я просто, засыпаю от этих видео, ты самая лучшая, наверное ты не читаешь коменты    но ты лучшая   
these puppies and lamb knows math   following her = food  it seems she takes care of them really well
beautiful girl ❤️
the fact that she makes so much money off of these videos but still decides to live this life style  respect 
مافي عرب😭🇸🇦🇸🇦؟؟؟؟
is this real, is this paradise, is she an angel   this is so very beautiful   
when i get depressed by reading comments full of hatred about china i come here  this is like the most friendly place towards chinese people  thank you liziqi  it has been a hard year to us 
plz make a video on your garden tour   i am very interested to see your garden   plz  hit like if u agree guy's 😍😍
i am feeling hungry but my wife's recipes are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, she is around me, good
sou o único brasileiro que gosta dos videos dela?
i feel like i'm watching a real life ghibli studio anime   damn
本视频观看数超过了七千万，去年我关注子柒时才五千多万人，一年涨了两千多万，太惊人了。另外，超过五千万观看的视频有四个，其中排第四的螺蛳粉从三千万追过了吊柿饼和竹沙发跃居第二，不可思议！我有点不明白，国际网友为什么如此偏好本视频？作为中国人，我更着迷于她早期的仙女型视频，如荷花酒，樱花茶，太魔幻仙境了，但却只有百万级观看量。10月22日，新浪微博公布了超级红人节v在山顶拍摄地对子柒的采访，16分钟，子柒第一次公开了自己的创作理念，令人叹服，也让人更深入了解到她的内心。她让我着迷。此视频上传youtube几分钟便下架了，国际网友无缘观看了，中国网友可上微博看全程。
трудолюбивая и хозяйственная девушка 
so we have found the princess disney always featured
when they made the popcorn and the roller just spontaneously combusted 😂
the melon seeds were sunflower seeds from a dried sunflower heart, i swear 
filmed with heart  super women  so talented  this snacks makes me drooling   😋
 covers her grandma’s ears  pop corn explodes  got scared and end up covering her own’s   so cute 
who else wishes they could have these snacks in there house during quarantine
youtube did not recommend this, i found it by myself 
disneyland productions  are  nothing compared to   liziqi 
i dont understand how 24k people disliked? shame they still dont understand the value of simplicity 
it's so cute watching the lil ones follow her wherever she goes    
i'm not a lesbian, but i wanna marry her just so i can live with her and follow her lead all day long 
this lady much more productive in a day than i am in a year not gonna lie lmao
прямо колдунья какая то   из простых вещей чудеса получаются   красота
her whole family can be proud of her  such a talented girl         我爱你！！
this is the life that thanos expect😂
sana all naay garden 
if i die and go to heaven, this is what i want my heaven to look like 
احبكم كولشش ♥️👌😍
i’m so glad youtube suggested me this video  it’s for sure among the most beautiful videos i’ve ever watched  everything is so carefully done and the editing is so sensible  i’m just in love with the channel  and the girl who cooks and does everything  haven’t found out her name yet  is precious  she looks like a green/forest fairy    please keep doing this amazing job   
snow white, cinderella can’t even compare to her 
she is so hardworking, doing millions of things every day  i feel like i am too lazy   😐
удивительно и завораживающе девушка похожа на актрису из дорам💕
seeing her makes me want to go to my village and live on my own   making small house   gardening,farming💜💜💜💜
muy lindo video, solo falta darle atención a los perritos son muy tiernos 
she should  release  a recipe  book,  it will be  easy for us 😋
in fact this video has like 14k dislike made me completely lost faith in humanity 
does anyone else agree that everything she makes looks absolutely delicious 
did anyone else’s mind explode when she pulled out those sunflower seeds?
so cute the sheep 
wowww nice view and abundant blessings
that physical type of life full of colours, fresh air, products straight from the nature, organisation to every preparation creates calmness in my soul  your videos are an oasis in my difficult, anxious city life  i love watching you  you make my day  god bless you  keep it that way 
y'all, i would love to trade my city life with this life 
totally amazing 😉
am i the only person who wants to see gordon ramsay’s reaction to her? lol
معقوله في حاجه بالروعه دي
5 55 this is the most precious moment ever she runs up to cover her grandma's ear but after the blast  grandma   "hehe    i'm cool" liziqi   5 59
嫉妒會讓人瘋狂，沒辨法，有些直播主必須耍寶無所不用其極才能得到點閱率，靜靜看完你的萬言信真是無比心疼，李子柒，不要活在別人的嘴巴裡，其實最欣賞的是妳對食材、生活、季節、親情透過鏡頭的詮釋，那份美好是無國界的，來自台灣的加油！
i just found your channel today and absolutely love it   i love the editing, music, quiet/gentleness to your videos  your environment is amazing  you live a very blessed life  i wish i could live with you, be your sister and learn everything i could from you 
she should become the brand ambassador of the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc   she is inspiring millions of people around the globe to opt for more sustainable and organic living  i wish and pray that her efforts reach larger and larger audience with each passing day and she becomes an agent of great changes in future    she is the daughter of nature   long live the princess    love    
two little puppies look like hungry 
who doesnt have desire to live as she does?
all i wanna know is why we don’t make popcorn like that  that microwave bullshit in my pantry is nothing compared to that awesome explosion
5 56 a cutie, isn't it? covering her grandma's ear and then a seconds later    😂❤️❤️❤️
i wanna see her feed the pups cause she’s straight up ignoring the cuties
i love the popcorn part she's trying to cover her grandmas ears😁😊
my god, i love this channel  everything looks so perfect 
батюшки,сколько труда  как она со всем справляется,удивительно  собачки такие худенькие 
6 00 so cute when she’s obviously a afraid of explosion but still covers her grandmother’s ears 😍
this is better to watch than any kind of hollywood movies
i would love to visit and just be immersed into their everyday culture  these videos bring my soul so much peace and happiness 
her videos came to my attention by my 10 year old daughter, she loved watching her videos on youtube  now we are watching it together and we both are fascinated and awe inspiring by her works, we are learning mandarin and this video will help us to know a little more about the traditional chinese food etc 
 the cinematography, the content, the editing skills  this is the most perfect video in youtube  
she’s got quality control for sure
i feel guilty watching this video and there isnt a single ad  some people make worst content and run ads about every minute or two 
اكو عرب بالطياررررة 😂❤️🇮🇶
john 3 16   for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son  jesus christ , so that everyone who believes in him may not perish, but have eternal life  💖💕
as a chinese,i am really happy to see people from different countries appreciate and love ziqi's video

جمال الطبيعه نشاط هذه البنت اذهلني
i feel so bad now picking up my phone and ordering food to be delivered to my door
what a smart girl she is and when she is cooking she doesn't want her mother's help  what a grown up girl 😘
i’m amazed every time by her   she is the hardest working girl i’ve ever seen  sure there are many others but speaking for myself    beautiful life, beautiful being, and beautiful work   ❤️
what a beautiful faerie like place in which you live  a lot of lovely fruits, nuts and resources to make your treats with as well  you are obviously very talented and the calm, hard work and dedication can be seen in your videos    passion, too 😊🍊🍋🍎🍐🍑🍓🍡🍰🍬 all of the food looks delicious  you and your grandma are too cute  👩‍🍳👵 and the animals  🐶🐕🐑
what on this earth could possess a person to even think of hitting the dislike button? ?  smh   
i thought she was making all those food for some gathering or events but       woww she has lots of food at home😋😌
令人向往的田园生活，不禁想起了30年前童年的日子，虽然远没有这么丰富。羁鸟恋旧林，池鱼思故渊，开荒南野际，守拙归田园。这才是人生的乐趣！
this video shows the most traditional way of chinese making popcorns, oh dear lord, all my childhood memories  ziqi, love you 
whenever you feel stressful, her video will make your life peaceful
conclusion   don't open a business anywhere near this lady  she can make everything

thanks ♥️♥️♥️
 if you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about liziqi   li ziyi    
 
 in 1990, li ziyi fell to the ground in mianyang, sichuan  her parents divorced when she was very young  later, her father died, and li ziyi became an orphan  his stepmother didn’t treat her well  li zizhen mentioned on weibo that he had had a half dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten 
 
 grandpa and grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take li ziyu home and live  when li ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school  at the age of 14, li ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8 year wandering life  her first life was very hard  she slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months 
 
 li ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan  in order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar  later, when talking about the matter, li zizhen frankly said  “i didn’t say that i liked music at that time, just to live, i felt that it was well paid ”
 
 in 2012, because grandma was ill once, li ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma  “being closer, i feel more at ease ”
 
 after returning, li ziyi opened a taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats  in 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, li ziyi was exposed to the short video platform meipai  until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of taobao business, li ziyi re entered meipai to prepare for his own video program 
 
 the reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment 
 
 in an interview with the living room of sina club, li ziyi mentioned, “all these things that are self sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous  in the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places 
 
 in the beginning, li ziyi gave himself a topic called “four seasons change, eat while you eat”  after the suggestion of meipai editor, it became “ancient food” and it is still used today 
 
 in september 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for li ziyu to get more attention in the future  sina weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support 
 
 as mentioned at the beginning of the article, liu tongming brought her weibo resources support 
 
 one day in september 2016, li feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private weibo message from “mr  l”  mr  l expressed his love for li ziyu’s video content, felt that he had fulfilled his taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her 
 
 for a long time after that, li ziyi received mr  l’s private letter  “it would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it  this is uschina’s proud traditional culture should be seen by people in china and around the world  “mr  l said in a private message 
 
 at first, after seeing these private messages, li ziyi didn’t care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar  until one day, mr  l came to the city where li zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk  mr  l’s politeness and clear logical thinking made li slowly drop his initial alert 
 
 this accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of li zizhen  not long after the meal was over, with the help of mr  l, li zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on sina weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing li zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head 
 
 this experience is partly recorded in a diary of li zizheng that year  some insiders close to the senior executives of weinian technology confirmed to tencent’s “shenwang” that the “mr  l” is actually liu tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported  daxiong liu, the founder of wei nian technology, an mcn company to which li zizhen now belongs 
 
 on december 8th, the reading volume of a weibo topic labeled “is li ziyi a cultural output” climbed to 800 million  li zizheng was once again on the hot search list 
 
 the video created by li ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now 
 
 extensive overseas communication is an important reason for li zihuan’s renewed attention  some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional chinese culture and cuisine  others think that her video is not completely true to reflect china’s rural life 
 
 even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a dj, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life it’s still just a fiction for character setting 
 
 an insider of weinian technology told tencent’s “deep web” that li ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by li ziyi himself  the popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself  in fact, both li zihuan and the micro reading team behind him were quite low key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs 
 
 until august 17, 2018, li ziyi’s eponymous tmall store officially opened  six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million  a year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the li zizhen flagship store exceeded 1 3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million 
 the value behind li ziyi’s ip is being quickly tapped 
 
 li ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength  but now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements 
 according to tianyan search, “deep web” shows that mcn hangzhou weinian technology co , ltd , which li ziyi belongs to, was established on february 28, 2013, with a registered capital of rmb 5 208 million  according to the introduction, wei nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates kol into ip through short videos and extends to consumer brands 
 
 the information of qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark “li zihuan”  the applicant companies are hangzhou weinian technology co , ltd  the product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, financial property management, catering and accommodation 
 
 not only that, wei nian also has inextricable links with li ziyu’s companies 
 
 according to the eye inspection, li jiajia  should be the original name of li ziyu  established sichuan ziyu culture communication co , ltd  on july 20, 2017, and wei nian is its shareholder, holding 51  of the shares  supervisor, li jiajia holds 49  of the shares 
 
 according to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind hangzhou weinian technology co , ltd , including greenland holdings, zte, xinhua media, vanke, light media, etc   
 among the shareholders of weinian technology, sina weibo is particularly eye catching 
 
 from wei nian technology to sina weibo, li ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to 
 in her own words, she changed from “a little transparent to a person who is so useless to society”  after entering the public view and being noticed by more people, li ziyi’s sense of responsibility has also become heavier 
 “i want to do what i can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non heritage cultural craftsmen, and i want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know  li ziyi said

好友圈养你
充满正能量的女人！
hiii i watched this video 4times  i want to visit ur village
i wish to try some of the snacks 
liziqi, you're such an inspiration to me   love your videos   there is so so much to be learned from you  sending you lots of love and light  🌻💖   just small detail, there is a sunflower seeds not melon seeds used in video   🙂
прям не девушка, а золушка👍
 she behaves like a k drama heroine  lovely 💕💕💕💕💕
you are a legend liziqi  i miss this kind of life   your place is a paradise, surrounded by flowers and vegetables, and your cute friends  i like your puppy and the lamb   your popo is so lucky to have you with her, a very loving grand daughter   i love all your videos  i will try your recipes from scratch   also, i love your oven  its unique  😍🥰 love from houston, texas 💐mimi ✨
this is a wonderland and she is a wow queen of it😍
wait a minute    isn't you tube is banned in china, i think it's illegal in china to use you tube
liziqi那裡的狂犬病大流行情況如何🙃
這段視頻顯示了利茲齊斯內心的孩子
i love this episode    i've watched it many times  i wish i had recipes for each thing
youtube, sometimes i question the things you recommend to me  this isn't one of them  thank you for this, this is lovely 
this channel is really awe inspiring  from the cooking and food presentation, and the music chosen  totally transports me to a fantastical realm  the production is really top quality  super fan here thank you 
безумно красивые и профессиональные кадры, потрясающие пейзажи 
i rewatched the part where the popcorn machine “exploded” so many times, watching liz cover her grandma’s ears and jump was so funny
happy chinese new year my motivated girl ❤❤❤ wish you luck in your life 
i just found a virtual paradise  😭💕 this is so beautiful  💕
不自由的中國~很虛假！
ngon thật
this girl is a perfect miracle    a hard past and now look at her    she’s living a happier life    she is my idol  🌸
she is the real life disney princess   her life so full of life    i love the part where she ran towards her grandma to close her ears
her youtube channel is only 1 year old and she already has 3m subscribers and more that 1m views on every single video, some of them have more that 5m views this girl is amazing  👍❤❤❤
meanwhile, i'm all 'ugh, i can't believe it's taking so long ' when my ubereats order hasn't come yet
she’s so strong  those baskets balanced on her shoulders are heavy  pomelos and ponkans are watery fruits, and they’re really heavy 
   if she is a dream then i dont want to wake up  
我从未见过如此能干美好的姑娘。新年快乐🎆🎊🎉你的视频让我心情愉快！
after watching this   i hate my life and i feel like i'm not healthy at all
各位同胞们，小弟在这里提前给大家拜个早年，不要红包给个赞就行
sheep's following along with the dogs are too cute💕💕
that moment when she covers her grandmas ear so that the grandma will not startle but turns out she’s the one who actually startled 🤣
she is amazing, but so many negative comments about your own lives   you have to find your own balance and beauty in your life  it doesn't have to be escaping the city life completely, or getting rid of technology   make time for what makes you happy next to your work and responsibilities  she's decided that this is her way to happiness   you might think that you need this, but you could be wrong  life is long enough to find out what'll make you feel accomplished, we just need to stand up and start to search 
best youtyouber i like you so much😍😍
我祝愿所有中国人和非中国人的中国人幸福快乐
the puppies and lamb following you are so cute  such well behaved little cuties   poor puppies got scared of the popcorn machine  so precious
5 23 when she called the uncle selling popcorn, that was so precious  reminds me of when i was in the province, whenever an ice cream or bread selling uncle pass by, i would shout loud to call them 
fairy tales type of girl, beautiful hardworking    you are real cinderella    your house, garden , forest , utensils , everything is like a fairy tale story   
what a intresting video
那三个小跟屁虫实在太可爱了
儘管我是朝鮮人，但我還是非常愛你，但我並沒有什麼區別，因為我不區分兩國，相反，它們必須以愛與誠心團結在一起，但有些人不支持。☺️     비록 한국인이지만 나는 당신을 매우 사랑하지만, 두 나라를 구별하지 않기 때문에 차이가 없습니다 오히려 오히려 사랑과 성실로 연합되어야하지만 어떤 사람들은 그것을지지하지 않습니다 ☺️     i love you very much, even though i am korean, but i do not have a difference because i do not differentiate between the two countries  rather, they must be united by love and sincerity, but some people do not support that ☺️     私は韓国人ですが、あなたをとても愛していますが、両国を区別しないので違いはありません。 代わりに、彼らは愛と誠意をもって団結するべきですが、それを支持しない人もいます。☺️     أحبك كثيراً ، بالرغم من أنني كوري ، لكن ليس لدي فرق لأنني لا أفرق بين البلدين   بدلاً من ذلك ، يجب أن يتحدوا بالحب والإخلاص ، لكن بعض الناس لا يؤيدون ذلك ☺️     koreli olmama rağmen seni çok seviyorum, ama hiçbir farkım yok çünkü iki ülke arasında ayrım yapmıyorum   bunun yerine, sevgi ve samimiyetle birleşmelidirler, ancak bazı insanlar bunu desteklemez ☺️     मैं आपसे बहुत प्यार करता हूं, भले ही मैं कोरियाई हूं, लेकिन मुझे कोई फर्क नहीं है क्योंकि मैं दोनों देशों के बीच अंतर नहीं करता हूं।  इसके बजाय, उन्हें प्यार और ईमानदारी के साथ एकजुट होना चाहिए, लेकिन कुछ लोग इसका समर्थन नहीं करते हैं।☺️      피곤한 글을 고맙게 생각하세요?😭💗

su nombre es li ziqi  ella quedó huérfana desde muy temprana edad, así que fue criada por sus abuelos     se mudó a la ciudad y vivió allí por un tiempo desde que tenía 14 años tuvo que trabajar como camarera y luego tuvo la oportunidad de trabajar como dj, pero cuando su abuelo falleció, regresó al campo para cuidar de su abuela  especialmente ella fue quien la crió     ahora carga vídeos en weibo, una plataforma china, ya que las personas en china no tienen acceso a youtube ni a facebook, etc  y sus fans vuelven a subir sus vídeos en youtube para que la otra parte del mundo pueda disfrutar de esta belleza 
   aquí hay una edición para responder a sus preguntas 
   1 esta es una cuenta oficial de youtube y ella se beneficia de esta cuenta pero no está segura de los otros canales 
   2   solía ​​producir su contenido sola, pero después de recibir el reconocimiento comenzó a trabajar con un pequeño equipo para ayudarla a fotografiar, etc , pero creo que no está fingiendo la forma en que vive 
   3 vive en sichuan  china  
   lo traduje de otro mensaje, para que las personas que no entienden muy bien el inglés, o sino simplemente, prefieren leerlo en español, o muchas razones más  de nada         pd  gracias por leerlo, espero mis likecitos  > ,3

this woman is very tough, i've seen her injured several times to create the world's best content  keep up the spirit, sister and hopefully have a long healthy life  warm greetings to grandma 😊
雖然沒經歷過，但是感覺好懷念這樣的感覺。現在社會裡面缺失的就是這樣的過程，很多人說年味寡淡，就是因為什麼都可以買，而不是親手去做。年嘛，正是因為過程才變得有味道。
全是传统的小时候的回忆和当今浮躁的社会看不到的东西，很震惊有这么多外国人点赞和评论，看到李子柒的申明视频得知，老外有很多并不知道这是中国，不知道李子柒是中国人👍，让他们也看看中国不只是世界工厂，不只有雾霾和工业…我们也有传承和美好的生活，希望为数不多的说中文的华人中国人把我顶上去让他们看到汉字评论！welcome to china
the puppies are the best part of this video oh and the cute sheep too 😍😍🌻🌹🌼
now   that's a productive busy lifestyle  very nice and nostalgic, makes you forget of the urban unhealthy hysteria  by the way, those people who put thumbs downs are very ungratefull ignorants 
the way she loves and cares for her grandma is so wonderful, this girl is a true treasure  ❤️
she lives in a place like heaven    blessed with nature, spared by humans
this woman will live longer than a hundred years because everything natural
sounds stupid but i have to say that i really want to cry after seeing this video  the heaven should be like this 
молодец вот хозяйка😘😘😘😘😘👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
happy chinese new year  新年快乐！
the way she closes her grandma's ear was so cute  love you ☺
山楂红，苹果圆，冰糖葫芦一串串。花生脆，冰糖甜，芝麻软糖一大盘。 板栗香，芒果鲜，锅盖窑里烤几遍。梅脯枣片小饼干，雪花酥糕惹人馋。 肉块方，大锅圆，麻辣手撕牛肉干。大米白，玉米黄，爆米花声报平安。 瓜子炒，花生翻，香酥蛋卷摆满盘。柚子香，桔子甜，冰淇淋蜜好温暖。 年货袋袋堆成山，包装一新迎～大～年！  在这个初夏的夜晚，子柒的视频再次让我重温了一下小时候的过年。。。
wait a minute , there are dislikes for this ? really ?   sick people   they are the reason our lives isn't heavenly like the one in the video
找个中文评论好难啊啊啊୧  〃•̀ꇴ•〃  ૭⁺✧  太棒了这视频
it is so cute, when she covered her grandmas ear while the uncle made popcorn     hahaha
小弟在深圳祝全球华人新年快乐！身体健康，万事胜意！
didn't god kick everybody out of the garden of eden? how this woman finds her way to the garden  🤔
she is so cute and her grandmother definitly cutes thing ı ever seen 
ar you kidddin meeee, how frikin cute is that lamb eating those vegetables my heart 
過幾天就農曆新年了，祝各位同胞新年快樂！中華民族因各位而偉大！
i'm so glad i found this channel  something about watching people do what they love so skillfully is just so satisfying  idk how else to explain it  i love these videos to pieces  please keep them coming  <3 <3 <3
her videos are one of the cutest and most relaxing videos in youtube
it so sweet of her covering her grandmother ears when the uncle open the popcorn maker
5 56 she is so sweet to her grandma it just completely melts my heart
your grandma is the happiest grandma to have you by her side  love to see you care for elderly woman 
protect this person at all cost  she is an inspiration  my bad for discovering her channel at this time only  but binge watching won't hurt anyway 
这集好长，看的好过瘾。  比打牌赢钱还满足  哈哈哈
patience, compassion and simplicity are the greatest treasure in man 
the little lamb with his wavy coat is the cutest thing in the world  😖😖
you remind me of my childhood, growing up in a farm with my entire family    we worked the land and ate from it    it was the simplest period of my life    
5 58   i like how liziqi is like jumping around and her grandma is so unbothered and smiling like u little silly kid 😂watch ya granny
these foods are seriously made me feel want to celebrate chinese new year
感恩子柒 有妳真好 尤其與阿嫲相伴，更是感動 每天與90歲母親乙起欣賞田園風光懷舊古厝…… 每天擁有好心情 我感恩！
why is everything in this video so beautiful?  just beautiful 
8 25  grandma  quit eating everything   liziqi  i’m not it’s quality control 🤣
她的影片給現代城市人帶來未能得到的夢想與期待  她不是大廚在展現每道菜的手藝  她也不是在詮釋什麼叫做農家樂  她只是在演示什麼叫做生活  非常棒的影片
我不知该怎么表达我对你赞扬，只能说一句我爱死你了。❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
すごい登録者数じゃ。びっくり‼️

長這麼大，頭一次看到葵瓜子果實是這麼簡單就能弄出一大堆！ 整部片讓我驚喜連連，留個言，掌聲鼓勵小柒，期待下部片子，哈哈！
amazing that’s  how we used to buy pop corn or pop rice  i would bring corn or rice to a street vendor and he would make it using that machine  the moment when he opened the machine is so thrilling to a kid
私は暖かい季節が好きですが、 この動画を見てると 冬も悪くないですね😭💕✨
she prepared food for chinese new year
natural but great production 
i used to have sleeping problems and most of the time i just couldn't sleep, not even a wink but since i started watching her videos, my mind was more at ease  her videos are so soothing  she calms me down, i'm speechless
this is the first youtube's channel where i watched all the videos  you always amaze me    
so we not gonna talk about he she grabbed those hot trays with her hand? she strong
what a beautiful place and people, those dogs are very cute 
never seen such a calm face even with that much hard work 
when i was a lil girl i had a book of chinese folk tale  written in bengali  which was very close to my heart there was a girl in that story who used to stay with her granny in a beautiful villlage of china  she too used have a gang of pet   she would also do many household chores just like this girl and her lifestyle was my childhood fantasy  i used have a pretend play just like the lifestyle of that girl mentioned in the story    when i watch this channel i feel very much nostalgic to see this pretty girl and her life    she is an amazing girl   god bless her and her granny  😊
希望婆婆常年百岁，永远陪着小柒！
看子柒的视频，炸我的豆腐丸子。祝子柒和婆婆农历猪年平安健康！祝天下华人农历猪年平安健康，吉祥如意！

i really love how her puppies and sheep following her, it is so cute  
不知道爲什麼，我一個大男人，看這視頻哭了。也許是感動世上有這麼寧靜的，美好的，親近大自然的生活，再看看自己每天在城市裏庸庸碌碌緊張複雜地打拚着，很嚮往。子柒祝福你和婆婆一直健康快樂，謝謝你的視頻。

i would love to be her apprentice 🌸
做的每一種食物都好看 看著就想吃😋😋😛
at least for day i want her life plz😭
i love the way they treat animals ☺️☺️
this video reminded me the time when i was smaller and lived on the border with china, we used to go to china sometimes on the weekends in winter and have these traditional sweets, sold on the streets   fruits in caramel on a stick, and when i licked it in  30 degrees my tong glued to caramel   
李子柒很棒啊
0 35 wow they also fires a fire  like that ,same here , we also do the same  ,miss winter
she lives in heaven
i like her doing everyday ❤️🇵🇭
هاذا احلى فيديو حبيتو كتير حلو 🌷😍
الله يرزقني روقانك
ولله حلوه هجي عيشه 😍
حلم حياتي نعيش بحالها 😔💔
all things natural woooow and wooow again for mango slice 😋😋       another thing is that      she is hard working girl 
she's a princess
mấy con chó nhỏ đáng yêu quá🥰
3000多万播放，赞赞赞！！这才是文化输出。
damn she's good at cooking and making videos plus she's beautiful
so happy to see that so many people in  the world love chinese traditional culture 
happy chinese new year am from ethiopia 💝💝💝
i'm surprised she didn't make the marshmallows herself😂
哈哈哈 有一个镜头被我回放好多遍： 爆米花要爆炸时子柒笨笨的飞快跑去捂着婆婆耳朵怕她被吓着，结果自己被吓得跳起来，好可爱呀。 一个弱小的女孩还想着去保护婆婆，可爱的婆婆，美丽善良的子柒🎈希望婆婆健健康康！
i cleaned up my room today  organized my clothes  thats a big deal  you are my inspiration  i think next week i might try canning 
having a grand daughter like her is a blessing from above 
the best chinese culture  ambassador, thousands love from nigeria 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
she's so cute when she cover her grandma's ears, but when the pop corn pops she jumps  she also surprises her grandma with that kind of crispy hot cake or whatever you call it  she's so sweet 😍
and why people compare her with disney princess?   she is much more than that   
she is a brilliant girl because she knows everything  she is hardworking girl 
this video makes me want to live in that peaceful village instead of crowd city😍
every time i feel lazy  i watch this girl and it inspires me to work harder  
her dogs and lamb is always beside her  lil pals ~ _  ~
that lil pup deserves to relish that stuff 
probably her videos are the only ones i watch without skipping  because i would be completely mesmerized by her work 
those puppies are soooo cute   
外国友人们好像沦陷了，根本翻不到中文评论了哈哈哈😄子柒加油！
she's getting more and more beautiful living in such peaceful and fresh area 
this is my most favourite video from liziqiii channel🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍋
the moment she covered her grandmas ears and got frightened,  my heart melted
the animals follow her like she is snow white  <3
happy chinese new year  祝全球华人新年快乐🍾️🎊🎈

一直听说墙外好评如潮 果真如此  厉害了
i love those puppies that follow her everywhere   so cute 
that's the most beautiful thing i've ever seen on youtube 😍
i can't stop watching  tasty better watch out
she's like a disney character 
when you got everything you need in your backyard/forest  demn
she’s so cute tho😂😂😂😩😩❤️💝 like she can cook, loving, caring her grandma pa such beautiful granddaughter and wife material ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
so this is what one with everything feels like 
i have insurmountable respect and admiration for this woman  not just from what i see in the videos, but the fact she's bringing back to new life an archaic way of doing things  because of her i've learned a lot about culture, process and reaction  also because of her, i've gained several new skills 
i’m so happy to see someone who can show the the different life of chinese people, neither just the miserable one in some chinese movies and western news, nor modern good life in some big cities from chinese media  from the comments, i found most of us, no matter where are you from, share the similar value and aesthetics  we are not so different 
i love how she love her grandma so much  ❤️
very hard working young lady  a very busy day 
wanted to cook something   but instead i ended up looking at this beautifull girl for more thank 2 h  😂 i'm just in love with this channel   congrats 💗
all the love from india 😍
祝福全球华人新年快乐。今年过年因为要考试没办法回国啦。我和子柒来自同一个地方，看到她的视频就想起了自己的奶奶，因为子柒做的就是很多四川女人会做的东西，代代相传。可惜到了妈妈辈很多人都不愿意学习了，很开心看到还有年轻人传承这些东西。另外，她做的菜我会做大半部分，也是奶奶在我出国之前教我的，怕我在外面吃不到家乡的味道。希望年轻人都能主动传承发扬我们的中华民族的传统文化吧~ 希望早日毕业，早日回到四川。
اذا اكو عربي حط لايك خلي نشوف كم واحد عربي مر من هنااا🌹🌹🌹الله يحفظ كل العرب اينما كانوو
the picture quality is so good  not to forget, this girl’s cooking and handicrafts skill is great too 
子柒加油呀！找句中文评论可太难啦！
what is your name
農曆新年 快到了 李子柒 祝福妳 每天都快樂 無憂無慮 身體健康 也祝福妳奶奶 長命百歲 萬壽無疆 來自台灣地區  一個平凡人的祝福
is this how she really lives? wow   😍 must be nice    
i just thought to myself 'this is beautiful' when i saw the beginning but when the digimon music actually kicked in at 5 16 i genuinely fell in love with this channel 
how the heck did this come in my recommendation?? but soo beautiful tho woww  
happy chinese new year beautiful lady and to popo  😍😍😍  i'm so inlove with all your videos    well done
beautiful  talented  respectful to her elders knows how to do everything  if the apocalypse ever happens i’m looking for her 
i find this so interesting and relaxing  i don't understand all the dislikes   
日本人で見てる人いる？

what is hwthrow
我的名字是馬塞洛，我是巴西人，我愛你的視頻，就像有一天知道你的城市，了解你個人，你的工作是非常漂亮和完美，您的頻道上表示祝賀。
18k dislike??? i’m sorry for them   come on  the animals love her too  that should tell you something
如果遇到什麼不如意的事情就來看看子柒的視頻有療愈效果。
想去子柒家過年,好有年味 
she is like a dream princess  best of luck dear   from, bangladesh 
everything she does is just poetry in motion bless her ◍•ᴗ•◍ ❤
i've binge watched this beautiful womens videos for the past hour and i'm just at awe by how much she knows 
gordon ramsay would absolutely fall in love with this place if he ever visited her  true cooking from scratch
不得不服，李子柒太全能了啊
子柒姑娘，你太棒了  你的视频精致而又真实，激发了我作为中国人的回忆。几千年来，我们的祖祖辈辈就是象你这样勤劳、能干，日出而作，春华秋实…… 希望中国人能回归生活的本原，有朝一日，东方文明回归。
好朋友 沒有背景音樂，堅果，切菜洗水跟周圍的鳥叫蟲鳴或是奶奶跟動物生聲音，真實的聲音才是閱眾要的，我們沒有大自然，沒有田，沒有禪意，沒有慢曼的生活，請給我們這些生活在城市裡，每一樣東西都用錢買，被金錢控制的人一點活著的感覺，拜託，謝謝。
she just inspire everyone to live a simple but a meaningful happy life   
after seeing this, i can attest that chinese food and culture is great  i am originally from india btw
there’s something so serene and beautiful about the way she works
this is literally how chinese people lived back in the past, as technology improves, less people live like this  it's amazing that a women like her still continues to do things the traditional way, it reminds me of the past  you can tell from traditional old chinese buildings, it's amazing, all hand made, people back then are so damn smart  now people all uses machines for everything, and yes it's efficient, but it feels different 
how can anyone dislike her effort and creativity  humans r so annoying somethimes 
she owes this to her grandpa  she must have been remembering him while making this furniture  don't you think? 😇🥰
i can't believe what i am seeing  this girl is incredible 
i am thoroughly convinced she is a forest spirit living with an old tree spirit
"i need to go buy a billy to ikea" nobody  liziqi  hold my bamboo
me making face masks, proud of myself  her  another level 
when a guy say girls can’t build anything without their help
she has an angelic look and i'm fascinated by her craftsmanship and strength  her grandmother approved  maybe she learned the skills from her 
ikea  we make the best furniture in the world  liziqi  hold my bamboo 
i'll just go ahead and say it  i am so in love with this woman  is it all legit or a bit fake?  i don't care  sometimes one just has to take something at face value and enjoy it for what it is  in her videos i see the way we are supposed to live 
this beautiful 🤩 young lady has some serious carpentry skills   lovely too watch her use some ancient chinese carpentry methods to build those fantastic looking furniture items  may you live a long life and prosper in your heritage    
看到有人說作秀，但你做不到這種秀，這就是她功成名就，你只能發文酸的原因。
that plant is a bless, specially for diyers  we wish bamboo grew all around the world  👍😎
i like how feminine and strong and disciplined she is 
we should have more strong and respectful female figures on youtube like her 
那个竹竿是不是很重啊！太能干了！🌹🌷❤️🌷
終於知道古人以何高超工藝技巧做出這麼多精美器物，謝謝子柒的示範。
hey i want to leave in that place with u it's quite peaceful environment 
me  i need new sofa   goes to ikea  her  i need new sofa   goes to forest 
天下无难事只怕有心人啊 고수의 향기가 느껴지네요~
i laughed at the end when she was like, "oh wait, let me go get changed "
eres maravillosa    todavía no creo que sos real,,puedo creer que sos mágica    gracias 😳😳😳
子柒超級厲害呀！
during interview, boss  so what can you do  ziqi  yes 
凄い、竹は滑るから制作に一苦労でしようね、 出来上りは綺麗で寝心地は良さそう最高ーよ
好强！会生活，能动手，比男的都强，厉害！佩服！前段时间小黄鱼上经常看到的头像原来是你
這麽"全能的女子"真的找不到第二位了！
知足常乐…爱护大自然的生活…好样的…！！
i hate when ppl reduce her only to a cooking channel  she's an engineer, a homemaker, the ultimate diy channel imo
真的是天才艺术家，田园艺术家
i heard from her older fans that before she did these type of calm country life videos she made woodworking/handicraft tutorial videos and honestly i belive them
让浮躁的心感觉很平静，百看不厌。。
what a beautiful scenery and a comfortable lifestyle is a dream that many people have always wanted to pursue 
i feel like even her grandma is amazed by her granddaughter’s many talents 
太強了！ 還有什麼柒姑娘做不了的！！！
40年前，我父母结婚的婚房，家里的木家具，床铺被褥全是父亲伯父和爷爷奶奶亲手制作的。感叹啊，现在长大了，家里经济上是也比以前富裕多了，但也同时失去了更宝贵的财富，因为祖辈的手艺在我们这代不能再传承下去了。
原来大家都喜欢反复看制作竹家具视频啊😄
子柒太有才，又心藏山林溪谷，诗情画意。好一难得的秀外慧中佳人。

本当に凄いです、美しい中国文化。 日本も本来の文化はとても美しいものが多いです。 互いの良いところを認めあって、古き良き姿を大切にしていけたら良いのに… 今はそれがとても難しいですね。 新しいものが沢山増えて、生活が便利になったとしても なにもない時の方が人の心は豊かだったんだろうな。 ありがとうございます、本当に良い動画です！！

this is so beautiful, as is everything you touch  you have such a gift, with plants and with people  so much love inside of your soul   you truly take away my anxiety when i watch your videos  i appreciate the calmness and feeling at one with nature   your videos provide that to us all   🙏🏻❤️🌈
and then there's me struggling to get a cap off my water bottle
watching your videos makes me want to become a better person   
this is so inspiring  even after completing engineering i don't know how to cut it accurately

como assim? chocada com o ser humano     uma artesã cheia d talentos como a liziqi, q construiu tudo isto com esforço e mérito próprio d um simples bambú     ficou um trabalho magnífico, mas n agradaram 25 mil pessoas q simplesmente descurtiram     eu sinto é muita pena destas pessoas invejosas e mal amadas      parabéns pelo trabalho maravilhoso liziqi  ❤️🇧🇷❤️
admiro mucho tu gran esfuerzo que realmente hacés en tu vida   muchas felicidades hermosa

this is amazing and her talent takes me on to another level  do we have humans like this still in existinance  i rest my case 💕 and feel embarrassed of myself   this talent and hard work somehow needs to be passed on to our lazy south africans
太強了吧 
when i saw the thumbnail few days ago in my recommendations, i thought maybe its some sort of short clips of drama videos so never clicked  i wasn't expecting this    she is so cool   
the background sound is so asmr type so peacefull😇
not to sound dramatic but being an artist and seeing her work until the sun came down , i cried,  i love how art can make us forget about everything around us and in the end that work created something really beautiful 
what a magnifisicent woman   💖 her spirit so bright 🙏

internet   builds stuff with ramen noodles  this blessing  nah, let me show you

madam, i'm both humbled and hypnotized by your skill, craftsmanship, art and beauty 
you never cease to amaze me  i love your videos and they help with the stress a lot  i wish the captions on youtube would work a bit more properly, or just learn the language  point is, you're amazing  please keep doing more videos and take care of yourself and granny   😊
i bet her grandma was same level talented and beautiful 50 years ago 
this is where ikea got their inspiration    this lady is the best role model for people everywhere

her chopper can cook, chop wood, make furniture 👍👍👍 multi function to another level   
wtf, i cant even piece together a drawer from ikea with instructions, yet liziqi builds furniture out of bamboo tree  feel so worthless 
this inspired me to do my home work and apply for jobs  i have social anxiety and have quit jobs due to anxiety   this makes me feel like i do nothing all day, i should be making furniture for my grandparents
is there anything this woman can't do?? i'm so amazed by her talents and skills
amazingly beautiful place and really pretty girl doing incerdible stuff  feels like another world 
i have no word to describe her , extremely talented
greece 💙 👍 🌳 💒 🌳 ⛪ ✔ liakos gr neo petritsi  serron 
my dad saw this and was so excited  he was born in hunan china in 1932, a province next to where this girl lives    he couldn't believe this "little girl" made furniture that he remembers sleeping on during summer to escape the heat when he was a child  he was impressed that she made it with he same finesse as the "old masters" did when he saw them do the work  he left home before he turned into an adult to fight the communist and lived most of his life in taiwan as an r o c  veteran/teacher, and he hasn't seen furniture like this, made in such a way, since he left his childhood home  so    this is legit   
i have been working my bamboo house in my durian garden, i wish u would be my wife    that is helpfull babe   
eating what u grow = amazing having tea on a freashly made bench made by you = next lvl
this is absolutely incredible
it is impressive  no workbench, no complex machinery, literally  "handmade"
 what kind of creature could "not like" this?
sorry li ziqu really sorry i am from india and the relationship between india and china is not too good  in my old memories i realy hate chinese but after watching you i really really like chinese      i learn that they are not too bad  i you are heart by my words please really sorry  love from india 🇮🇳
my grandma have the same when she was young her and her sister always play chess using a cap of pastic bottle until she had sooo many bamboos
cant believe ppl like her still exist in this artificial generation
as a woodworker myself, its interesting to see the way the same tecniques are utilized on such a different material to achieve a very flattering result  in particular, i liked the heat bending for the bamboo table   it's all very simple, nothing particularly difficult  but these simple tecniques and materials are used to achieve a great result 
oh my god    i can't even assemble ikea furniture properly 🤣
真的假的  那麼出色  😃🤔
there is so much work and discipline in this video, but you are so graceful that it seems effortless   
and here i am still trying put together this ikea piece
這太強了
see  it does exist  femininity, physicality, and master craftsmanship  true beauty 
a lot of respects to liziqui ❤
was expecting her to fly through the bamboo forest on the way back 
何回見ても素晴らしい👏
eu sou do brasil e dei 👍
wow the atmosphere is amazing and beautiful  all the flowers and trees 😊
this girl is amazing
you're very talented  very calming video  great to see resourceful craftsmanship  thanks for sharing
beauty with brain❤️
nobody   youtube recommendations  lmao you wanna see how to build a bamboo sofa ?
you're so hard working girl really
and i think getting up to charge my phone is hard work
she’s so breathtakingly beautiful, one half of my family comes from her province  the south all along the yangtze is so beautiful too, having grown up in the northwest corner near the border of kazakhstan, i really wish i grew up here instead 
omg she's so talented n amazing   nice nice❤❤😘😘
genuinely one of the most fascinating things i’ve ever watched 
子柒啊！如果不嫌棄的話，請笑納我的膝蓋～
all her movements are very quick and energetic, but incredibly precise  amazing to watch a master at work 
kesini gara2 berita di tv😂
bro this was incredible  the amount of patience this had to have taken is unreal  props to this girl who committed to making these beautiful masterpieces 
full makeup, money spent on stuff, following the useless ephemeral in daily life make everyone ashamed here 🙄 she seems one of the most beautiful girls even without heavy makeup and decorating herself  the aura of true princess is somewhere your heart knows, your talents that shine through all your life and the one next to you 
so amazing  😍
no words for your efforts girl,hats off on you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
she’s beauty, she’s grace   she’s got a way with her hands 🖐  princess 2019
i put off cleaning my shower for like 5 days coz i can’t be assed, meanwhile she has built a houseful of furniture, formented enough food to last a year and cooked 100 amazing meals from scratch  she is my hero ❤️
you are intelligent and extraordinary  love from bangladesh
people who disliked works in ikea
i want a girlfriend like her, just amazing 💕
she's the perfect example of "i can do everything"
words cannot express how happy i was to find this beautiful channel  my mother died last week totally unexpectedly and watching your videos is cleansing my soul  thank you from the bottom of my heart x
she carries that all the way alone??   my goodness, wish i could give her a hand though she might not need any she is one hell outta superwoman    ♡♡
i'm here complaining about the instructions on how to build a trampoline
bear grylls  i can survival in this forest for a month    liziqi  hold on, let me build a city here 
今晚终于等到本视频超过50m点击，紧跟在年货小零食和吊柿饼之后居第三，它在子柒制作类视频 秋千，锅盖窑，蚕丝被，洗手台，活字印刷等 中最具代表性，超喜欢，百看不厌。
me  the perfect girl doesnt exis    youtube recommemded 
not only being a talented chef, carpenter, artist and so on,  ziqi also demonstrated her bravery of conquering any difficulty with her bare hands, and in a skillful and graceful way  for kids living in cities nowadays, ziqi is a precious role model for them 
do you ever look at a comment and realize, man, that would’ve been a great idea 
incredible  i'm glad i came across this video 
i was about to type she needs to make pillows and then she started making pillows
straight to the point and no edm this is ｈｅａｖｅｎ
and i complain about assembling my ikea side table    which i still manage to screw up somehow 
she’s so gorgeous and the way she works just captivates me  ✨✨
девочка конечно молодец , но работать без защиты рук и глаз   обесценивать свое богатство и уникальность
我是一位土耳其姑娘、以前在中国留学过、后来回国开始工作了。工作跟中国或中文没有任何关系、但没办法嘛。梦里有中国、一边想念想它、一边继续在土耳其活着。很想很想中国的时候，就看您的视频。您的视频让我回到我的第二家。感谢您给我们看这种很有特色的生活方式。感谢您的一颗努力的好心。
this might sound weird but you doing these things make me happy to be alive
maturity comes when one accept dislike   ignore it 
here's the translation  i have been wanting to buy a sofa set but a good eye catching set costs over 10k rmb  then last week i remembered my grandpa made a sofa set before  so i took his idea and try to make it  this is bamboo season, ideal to use to make a back basket, a chair and a rack and will not get infested with bugs  i made a back basket, a folding fan and a tray before but never made a sofa set  i made a lot of mistakes but with trial and error i finally made a monk bed, an empress chair and a tea table  very happy, very happy  coming from a smilely person who just saved a ton of money 
魔兽世界熊猫人
i find no words    only  respect   
oh, god, i'm so sorry  bless his sweet and accomplished and something very beautiful who is himself like him to be like him lake lake lake lake come on
but honestly she got mad crafting skill, here me with all kind of equipment and machine but can’t even build a simple box
she uses that cleaver for everything  where can i buy one?
i love of all liziqi's videos  she is a true spirited and hardworking young woman  in fact, six months ago i was all over the internet looking for 'life skills simple life' for a character i am writing about and instantly it recommended me to 李子柒 liziqi
 and  我们的小喜 xiaoxi's culinary idyll  i follow both of them and thanks to their vast knowledge i have more understanding about chinese tradition among other life skills  i have found myself now growing my own veggie garden  small apartment , i am trying out shu embroidery, and building my own furniture  fb marketplace old items to reusable  and decorating my place  yea  i don't have bamboo in my backyard but i make them as i go, and all this thanks to liziqi and xiaoxi  😊 🧡 🧡 🧡
my brain  now ive learnt， i want it  my hands  no you dont 
this girl just took minecraft to a whole other level, meanwhile im struggling to put up my ikea furniture up
my brain  ill go early to sleep tonight  me at 3am   _building sophisticated old furniture from bamboo_ 
i wish i was just as talented as her, she’s so amaaazing omg
i would rest for probably a year or so, after carrying that much weight on my shoulder all the way through the woods  i adore her so much good god
i think we just found the perfect match for primitive technologies guy
she’s so gorgeous, yet super skilled  she made me question my life  i’m a nerd   24/7 behind a computer, so this is a new world to me  haha
she can make furniture, clothes, food, and stay beautiful  forget super woman she should be what girls aspire to be like  amazing, she's just amazing 
awww   she's so hard working and loving to her grandma 😢💕
4 12 it's so satisfying how she measured the gap so accurately that when it folds around the bamboo it stands at 90°  what an intelligent woman
i’m so jealous of her long beautiful hair
5 52 do you know why she's "touching" her head? she is rubbing her hair with the needle, so the needle gets lubricated by hair oil  very traditional way of doing it  i've seen my mother doing this way when i was very young
me  takes an axe with me to cut the trees  liquizi  takes an litchen knife
this is so freaking amazing and the ending was so cute    wholesome content right here
talented and beautiful woman  i found happiness just watching this 
those 10k dislikers are those who are jealous of you
is this the ultimate waifu?
she makes me wanna be   productive
那些嫁给您的人，将非常高兴，我相信！。上帝祝您成功和简单。我来自巴西
 nàxiē jià gěi nín de rén, jiāng fēicháng gāoxìng, wǒ xiāngxìn   shàngdì zhù nín chénggōng hé jiǎndān  wǒ láizì bāxī
منو عربي هنا ينطي لايك اعتقد بس انه عربيه 😂😂 🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶
she doesn’t have time to gossip, to complain, to sue people, watch tv, compare herself to others, to envy or have jealousy, looking at social media, she is just the best role model for women everywhere   i love the way she loves her grandma 
i think that liziqi never gave heart to anyone   
is it just me thinking how nice the colour grading in the video is? okay 
this is officially a therapy for me  seeing a multi talented young woman like you fills me of joy  good job  👏👏👏👏👏
each of those bamboos are heavy  the natives here in philippines cant even carry 2 at once  this woman is immortal
this lady is my hero, she makes so many amazing things i never thought possible even as a craftsperson myself
watching this makes me think  what am i doing with my life?
respect 🙏👍❤
do u find snakes while doing this??
aww   my heart  how could she be sooo amazing    how did she master all those skills? watching her videos makes me feel like i haven't done anything great in my life   she's so full of life   like the place that she's living beautiful   amazing  mesmerizing❤️❤️❤️
yes it is really good work
the perfect woman doesn’t exi 
服你👍👍👍
she is the perfect definition of a strong independent woman 
incroyable bravo 👍👍👍
she is so beautiful ,and the way she works is even more beautiful😍
i really like you the way you stay with your grandmom  peacefully✌ and happily 🥰🥰keep working and may god shower his bless in yours family 🤗
no glue  no nails or screws   still, she seems to achieve perfection   this is probably the most beautiful thing i'm going to see today   o_o
i am surprised by how strong she is
dude she even changed her whole outfit in like two seconds she’s gotta be a deity or something
lessons from liziqi   1  focus  no distractions  2  determination  following through till the end however long it takes  3  working closely and in line with nature  4  being occupied  5  learning new skills  result  mental peace  no anxiety/depression  and a joyful life   thank you for your contribution to humanity 💐 
i wouldn't be surprised if one day she built a nuclear power station
finally some good content, yt algorithm   im very amazed at your strength and skills omg 
the production quality is through the roof   
she is a real life superwoman 
she is so talented
head architect  alright you’ll be designing half the building, inside and out  what tools do you need?  her  yeah uh, a hammer and some bamboo   head architect  oh 
she can be a carpenter, designer, dress maker, make up producer, farmer, and chef all at the same time😍😍
made me realise she's living like those people in historical chinese dramas  wow
camera quality so strong could film a movie with dat
ok  can somebody please invite her to come visit america? let me know and i will drop everything to come meet her i’ll even chip in for her plane fare 
she is making furniture the traditional way  i am glad i had a chance to watch her video, it's a fast food age and people forgotten the true beauty our ancestors left behind
ادك على راسي؟    كلولي على شي متعرف تسوي ليزيكي
i cant properly put together an ikea furniture with a manual  this woman is a goddess
i love u❤️🔥
12k dislikes from ikea employees all over the world 
bamboo is very strong yet looks easy to cut and carve  now i want all my furniture to be from bamboo  i thought my diy were nice  hers is amazing 
the knowledge of knowing the characteristics of the wood and creativity is just astonishing 
i really don’t understand why people would dislike this ??
"yeah hi, police? i'd like to call in a complaint about my neighbor  yeah shes outside at 2am making beautiful furniture, and it's ruining my ability to live in denial about my useless existence"
just assuming we have all been gathered together randomly by youtube’s random algorithm  let’s take a second to praise the lord above 🙏
so  pretty and sweet
so she makes an entire living room set for her home  meanwhile, i can't be bothered to throw the single load of wash i did today into the dryer  
the people who disliked this video are just jealous
 having people over  we dont hav enough chairs   this girl  wait  hold up 
if there's ever a zombie apocalypse i know where i would go    great content btw 👍🏻
good job god bless you        omg      
moral of the story  get yourself a girl who can make a bench
这竟然有24k的踩，那些人脑子里到底在想什么？
i love the little haha when she stood on the homemade couch  this is amazing,  i can't even make a grilled cheese sandwich
素敵！雰囲気もすごく好き  i live in japan, however i can rarely see such a beautiful environment   why? both countries locate in same asia   anyway, i wanna live such a beautiful place 
she is no actress  she handled bamboo like expert which takes years to mater  i know because when i was younger i made kites using bamboo 。
this is soo calming and soothing   its like getting stress free   god  this girl is super talented
more than talented and creative, i really have enjoyed watching her handcrafte and handling bamboo, and finally the outcome is amazing 👏    
after watching several of her videos, i am very much convinced that there is nothing this woman can't do
nhìn e nhỏ thế nhưng sức khỏe vô biên
this woman is so beautiful and powerful and i hope no one ever gives her any trouble ever in her life 
amazing,she makes me think off my mother  she used to make outdoor bathroom and outhouse and she even got the wood off another house that sold the wood so she could rebuild it again and that house is still used by my sister in south america  i am hooked on izy video now for a few days and i hope she makes a lot more and i hope she is doing well and grandma  i had a goat i had to look after and we always had chickens and ducks and ones we had a farm off pigs  my mum had a parrot and always had dogs so now i don,t have my mum here and she is in heaven i think about all that  thx izy love u 
the pencil behind the ear must be a universal carpentry thing 
people who disliked this are clearly jealous of her lifestyle 
extraordínário   
the forest is her free ikea store 
how many skills she has?  she can be a cook, taylor and she can make a furniture   plus she seems never get tired and physically strong 😅
she is so talented, this is how i would like to live
it's a interesting lifestyle she has  she makes stuff from the things she finds, a very eco friendly way of living  i wouldn't pull it off  respect 
اريد واحد عربي مافيش
i'm stunned that she casually went out, grabbed some bamboo from the forest and then made this 😲🤯
the 20k dislikes are insecure they can't do what she can 
me  calling two of them for just chopping the bamboos
when you mastered every ikea product and dont know what to do
her and her grandma deserve all the happiness and blessings in the world
she is so productive  i feel my whole life was a waste    i wanna be like her  she is simply amazing
i cant even follow an ikea instructions manual  hella props to her omg 
all glory to jesus christ, may jesus bless you   i love that bgm
and i can't even put together a bookshelf from ikea 
so basically you live in the garden of eden where everything is perfect   must be nice
her  can carry a dozen gigantic bamboos without tripping   me  can carry my phone and trip on air 
bạn giỏi quá chúc mừng nhé 🔔👍😍😍😍
and all this for share a cup of tea with grandma   great   
wah 🖒
whew getting a little hot in here  i think im in 💘
she certainly didn't steal nobody's job from the america 
this is wonderful mam
her videos were introduced by my kids' chinese teacher  when my kid showed me this video, i told my kids, "nah, do you really believe on that?" well,  weeks later, as i became addicted to those videos myself, i believe more and more her talent and strength  i truly appreciate that there are still such pure and peaceful minds out there, to inspire all generations 
ياأللهي على طبيعه
this is what mother's need to teach their daughters not how to become a princess, cinderella or frozen yet be the proverb 31 woman 
木直中绳，輮以为轮，其曲中规，虽有槁暴，不复挺者，揉使之然也。

omg how strong she is   i have personally experienced cutting and lifting these bamboo trees  although  those trees look thin and light, truely it is not  those are very heavy, strong and cannot control due to its easticity    i was really surprised by seeing she is lifting 5 or 6 full bamboo trees   omg     it might be the power of her healthy foods  good luck

with this lighting, music, and production quality you could’ve made a mid budget k drama but you had to pull a 180 on us and make a fricking sofa out of scratch  10/10 excellent video 
هي العيشه اصح👍

something about this feels so unreal  from the music, the asmr sounds, and the scenic environment  it’s so magical  ✨  i could watch this all day  😌
she is a brilliant girl  she has done everything in the easy way 
젊은 처자가 정말부지런하네~ 영상미가 넘좋아요♡ 저런분이랑 같이 살 남잔 전생에 나라를 구한사람이여야 할거임 ㅋㅋㅋ

wow  beautiful  
wowwwww👏👌👏
me   mom let me make some paper flowers  my mom   be careful with the scissors  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
奶奶的到來，重述了「中國的愛」，可以是一句話，一個動作，文化底蘊=無價之寶。
when i was 4 years old i used to see the mason workers used to work in our hone for various reasons  from there, as a hobby, i start to do creative carpentary  but, li is really extra ordinary who just used bamboo ingredients to build bamboo furnitures  thank you li, to teach us more traditional carpentery 
i remember my childhood to her pitching water using bamboo,caring woods in your back or shoulder   i wish i watch this since then because its very educational and realistic   thank you i wanna do everything i watched when i go back to my country and share my knowledge with my beloved husband because he is a farmer and i learned a lot from him too  keep safe and long life to your grandma  
wonderful girl almost professional in her activities
i think there are more non chinese people than chinese people watching her videos 
i am watching this epesode several times, love it so much🤩🤩
这不是我家的竹林吗，谁让你砍了！
i don't even know how i got here, but i love this
not only she is pretty but the stuff she makes are pretty aswell ♥ hatsoff to this lady 🌟
she be out here making a while ass livingroom set with her bare hands and some of yall cant put an end table together without instructions
sexist  woodwork is a man's job this woman   observe   edit   sry i thought bamboo some sort of wood because of how strong it is, also thankies for the likes  >
هالبنت خرافية 🥴
i don't know why i watch stuff like this, i guess because its peaceful to me, and it brings peace to mind   the music, her  surroundings  the flowers, and the work she put into the furniture  😊 is  relaxing
what it’s actually like crafting bamboo diys in animal crossing lol
i can hear jackie chan's voice saying "chinese bamboo dont break"
her grandma must be very proud of her this is what the real definition of “people” is 
don’t know why his got recommended to me but i’m glad it did  video is filmed beautifully and i think i’ve fallen in love with the lady in the video 
“how many skills do u have?”  liziqi   “yes”
all that education and degrees can't match level of skills she have
wow and here i am complaining about putting together some furniture from ikea smh🤦🏾‍♀️ 
when your waifu power is at max level
there is a saying  poverty limits people’s imagination  after watching li ziqi’s video, i think laziness also limits people’s imagination  i never imagined a young beautiful girl could do so much by herself     
i saw an interview with her where she mentioned that her grandfather made furniture and taught her all about it when she was younger  it's wonderful to see that she keeps the tradition 
respect ✊🏻🖤   also i think it’s literally the first time in ages youtube recommended something actually good to me 
she should come together with al these people who make the underground pools with sticks and build and entire country
chinese ikea proverb  use machete instead of allen key 
very strong girl, those bamboos weigh a lot
she makes me feel proud of being a woman  her skills impress me always  a true diamond  😍 😍
i never seen a strong, beautiful and creative woman like her  she's amazing 💚  edit  38 likes    thanks edit  112 likes😱arigatōgozaimashita❤️😊
uhm  miss, first if all, your hair is very pretty  second, thanks for showing up in my recommendations
others  homemade pancakes out of scratch  her  homemade clothes, bed, blankets, dresses, couches, furniture out of scratch 
don't you love when youtube recommendation is actually working?
i feel my life so pale compared to her skills  
офигенная девушка  надо её  с адвокатом егоровым познакомить    
wow  she is cute,pretty,strong and self dependent woman  and she is a real example of beauty with brain   
wth everything around that place feels so magical
this is one of the most comfy videos i have ever seen 
this is people that live to the 100s years , healthy calm life
i love the granny  she's cute  reminds me of my grandma who passed away in feb of 2019  grandma, you're always in my heart 
she deserves more fame than all the celebrities and instagrammers chasing after it 
bamboo is heavy af   she looks skinny but pretty sure she’s actually muscular
i am a hawaiian born japanese woman who practices traditional chinese medicine and you have once again made me fall in love with chinese culture     i didn’t know mugwort could be used as a filler for cushions   i wonder how it must smell   i also loved the technique you used to bend bamboo   it looks beautiful in its green state, but i’m guessing it will age into a nice beige color     it totally looked as if you had done this before   your tools were so specific and your movements were so deliberate and efficient 
every move she makes is dripping in confidence at first i was jealous because of all the cool things she can do and build and all the knowledge she must possess but i realize it’s her confidence and sureness i wish i had she’s amazing
being a women i am very much inspired by her dedication hard work calmness  and simplicity        she is a great inspiration to people all over  world especially to the women    🙏
in this cruel world, i didn't knew that such peaceful life exists 
一年多前朋友傳來的視頻，第一次看到李子柒的視頻。後來陸陸續續收到朋友傳來同一個，看過後真的大開眼界。小時候隔著一條小溪，就是一個竹子工廠，天天看著一大票大漢扛著山上砍下來的青竹，經過殺青，做成竹竿，竹凳，竹桌            真的不是一件輕鬆的活。竹子這個材料不好處理，纖維很韌但是整個竹竿易裂，所以看到一個纖纖女孩在做這樣的視頻，即便是擺拍，也是不簡單。👍👍👍
hard working woman and clearly extremely smart  beautiful
she make everything look so easy
now this is whom i call " the wonder woman"
竹筷竹碗竹花瓶，竹凳竹架竹茶几。
 竹盒竹箱竹笔筒，竹盖竹筛竹簸箕。
 笋壳粽子竹筒饭，竹笼竹篓竹笊篱。
 竹篮竹筐竹灯罩，竹帘竹墙竹凉席。
 竹扇竹笠竹沙发，竹床竹枕竹躺椅。
 绿竹千变又万化，看我竹神李子柒。

having friends from other cultures makes me more creative  in fresh ways about space and how people create their own world and environment  it is best way to connect between creative thinking and cross cultural relationships 
я вот только одно не понимаю  какие козлы, поставили дизлайки? 
好像在拍古裝片，画面很优美彷彿在世外桃園
i can't even make my bed right lol i gotta step up my game   she's incredible~
정말 대단하네요  ~~이분 영상은 항상 끝까지 시청하게되네요
i'm the only one who thinks it  haha 3 47  was very cute?
im thinking of making  a bed frame with bamboo  i wanna make the way you make it  without machinery  all by hand  if only everyone could live like this, having to make everything on your own  instead of going to the grocery store for veggies for example you grow them  it the work that makes it rewarding and understanding what life was like back then  before us  im so proud of you, it so hard i know, but it amazing seeing what goes on to give your family comfort, food, clothes, but more importantly doing this because you want to  remember, only do what you feel is happy for yourself and insure you can eat, drink, rest especially, but also have time for yourself   make sure you care for yourself, do not over do it, it will affect your health 
she is the most talented person i have ever watched on this platform  👏
i like how feminine and strong and disciplined she is giản dị
no tengo ni la mas palida idea, de que fue lo que dijo en el titulo  v
amazing wow 
it looks like i am watching chinese historical drama
simply astonishing in every sense of the word  the skills that this young woman has is inspiring  the furniture that she has made with her own hands using hand tools and no hardware, the simple beauty of the finished product is just amazing  wow 
amei  mas podia fazer mostrando o passo a passo 
i love it when she makes stuff out of bamboo 
more than 47 million views wooow
you can bee proud of you, my dear liziqi, you are so     i have no word to say that   bravo 👏👏👏👏👏🥂🥂
has anyone else noticedhow pretty she does her hair?
china or japan,i don't know
congratulations you got 1m likes   
🥺🥺🥺
其实这些活还有很多中国人会做，很多中国人在做，也正在放弃做，但是是你通过媒体的形式让大家知道，这是美好且值得学习的传统工艺，不要忘记先辈留下来的艺术而只去学习别人的。给你赞
no, no, no, no, no    you can't be this pretty and so talented  it's just not fair  wow
she make her entire living room from scratch  what do i do to my life 
did anyone notice that she didn't use one single metal nail? ? 
drop a like if this is the type of beauty you will want to marry
never in my life i'm jealous this much of someone's life
i don't know how to say it in chinese   but what you make, the way you make all the things are awsome    you are an amazing person 💕 thanks for sharing all this peace and beauity with the world
thank you for sharing your expert skills and beautiful furniture 
i wonder how many cuts she's suffered through her lifetime to reach such level of patience and artistry
一個人扛拉著這麼多竹竿，還是個女生，，，，， 看著莫名感動， 心想，一個女孩子家家，上山下海堆磚砌瓦，無所不能， 到底你是受了什麼樣子的遭遇才讓你擁有這麼強大的生活技能  總歸，讚賞你的行動能力    手套還是考慮戴一下吧！ 
"ok" this lady has some serious skills up her sleeve, many generations of knowledge and hard labour passed down through family to end up with this beautiful garden of eden,i hope she has children to pass this priceless knowledge to next generation 
me  watching her cleverly cut and bend bamboo    "well, would you look at that " i think i said it thirteen times throughout this video  she held the bamboo steady with her foot while cutting  i would have managed to slice off my own leg while simultaneously cutting the wrong spot on the bamboo 
give this lady some rocket fuel and she'll be the first woman to land on the moon 
low key asmr  ?   edit yes
i don’t even deserve to marry one like her she’s way out of my league
this feels like if hbo did a mini movie  very well done 
shooting and editing is very powerful
w0w nice work  she worked more than a week for this video and what she got 6k dislikes???  people who disliked this video eather they are jealous or they are just stupid
i once assembled an ikea desk and bookshelf  i thought that was an accomplishment 
she never ask to subscribe n share   to press bell icon and all     but her vedio is sooo beautiful    natural    peaceful   by watching her vedio we feel so blessed happy n bliss    she dont have to request for anything     automatically lots of people are subscribing n watching 
🇷🇺🙏🇨🇳 девчонка молодец, мастер своего дела  well done girl master of his craft  👍 👍 👍
and then there’s the common folk who struggle with an ikea dresser  absolutely amazing 
اني كاظم 😙😚
now i have no doubt that the great wall of china was built      by chinese women 
she needs to have her kids to pass those skill to them already    for real this girl is so talented in everything
невероятная девушка  как она это делает? волшебство🔥😱😻
how hard working you should be just to drink cup of tea with your grandma 
i'll have exam this morning  yet watching some bamboo sofa making at 2 am =/
у меня лобзик/шуруповерт/цыркулярка/винтоверт/иещекучавсякойхуйни, а я ничего подобного не смог сделать до сих пор  кажись бамбуковой рощи не хватает под жопой 
if you have a bambu forest,who needs ikea? 🤦‍♂️
我自己的外婆，83歲過世的，那已經是30多年前的事情， 我記得我小時候，也總是覺得我的外婆是超人， 因為他會飼養各種動物（雞鴨豬牛狗都有），也會種稻和各種植物， 砍竹子做各種傢俱和竹簍，甚至編蓑衣．草帽．．． 也會自制蕃薯粉，更別提各種糕點，其實生活裡的大小事物，衣服鞋襪等等等 都是自己生產製作．．． 但我的外婆並不是特例，他那個年代的女人，都是這樣 因為他們就是需要過活，而且在成年之前，就早已精通各類的生活技能 這樣才能覓得著好婆家．．．  寫這麼多，除了子柒的影片，讓我想念起我的外婆， 還有更多的是想表達，子柒這麼多才多藝，那完全就是從小的歷練和磨礪， 她充滿繭子的手，只是生活自立自強的縮影， 當有人覺得不可思議，甚至懷疑的時候， 請記得那只是有人替我們做了這些生活中原本該會的事情， 我們要心懷感謝，而不是置疑  子柒～你真的很棒～祝福你和婆婆喔～
how many slaps for dislikers ?
this girl has got serious skills  what an asset she must be to her family and friends  loves her♥️
she's so strong, talented, disciplin, feminine, she's good at doing everything'  is she really a human? i wanna be a human like her
in china your ikea is a bamboo forest
whoever she marries is one hell of a lucky guy    this girl can do anything  like literally anything  way to go girl    i love how independent you are and it resonates how much love you have for what you are doing  oh not to mention, how much care and love you have for your grandmother   discovered your videos today and i instantly subscribed   love all of your videos   i love how genuine, pure and simple they are   looking forward to many more videos from you   love from the philippines    
6k dislike? wow so many lazy haters 🤔
okay youtube recommend  you did good this time  this was a great watch
i would have lost 4 toes and two fingertips in the process   
i don't know how i got here but it's pure eye candy, video is nice and crisp too   i was thinking in my head no way that's staying together without nuts and bolts  she uses nails made out of bamboo 🤯
很多人有说怎么会这么多东西，我外公当了一辈子农民，不像现在的人一样，通俗来说就是没跟上时代。 他什么都习惯自己做，年轻的时候打了几年工，做过厨师，赚了钱在老家盖了个三层的房子，大概二三十年前吧。 包了一片小山，自己种了果树，会打铁，会木工，会捕鱼，会酿酒，包了十多亩地。黄焖鸡做的很好吃，腊肉很好吃。 现在年纪大了，心脏有问题。儿子女儿一直劝他不要再种地了也不听。从来不愿意到儿子女儿家去住，我记忆中我外公到我家里来只有两次，一次是我十岁，一次是我妈四十岁，都没吃晚饭。 过着传统日子，身上有许多技能的人很多，只是他们都不愿意做成视频上传到网络上来而已。 有些人的质疑，显得自己无知，无能以及懦弱。靠着虚张声势来博得存在感，却弄不清楚存在本身是什么。
难怪这么久没拍视频了，原来都制作成一集了😍对我而言这一套竹子沙发真的很花时间，又加上套子上的字纯手工缝制，真的很好看又环保♻️真的很了不起👏🏻佩服佩服😊👍🏻
if you are a person who disliked this video reply on this comment and tell me a good logically reason you did
if there's one woman that can survive anything then it is liziqi  very much admiration for this beautiful lady,  will you marry me and be my queen 💝 ?
お腹すいてる時にこの動画を見ると 自然と空腹が消えるんだよね しかも可愛い  ˘༥˘   ｽﾔ
imagine what her resume would look like   
你很可爱，喜欢努力工作，我真的很喜欢喜欢你的女孩，我爱你❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
almost 1 million likes  wow i'm so proud of her  
hello “ liziqi ” i am from morocco  good luck to you  ,  keep going  i wish you tell us more about   winter  episodes , thanke you so much you did a good work 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🌷😍 such one video is unlike athoer it is like a piece of art not a n ordenary ork ❤️👌 your work is like beotefel art 🌟

李仙女展示中國傳統智慧的優質生活方式，不用花錢也可以過自給自足的詩情畫意田園生活，與大自然為伍是多麼幸福快樂！健康又安祥！令人讚嘆不已！👍👍👍👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹😍😍😍😍😍🙏🙏🙏🇨🇦
she has precise carpentry skills   for the bamboo furniture, its amazing that its possible to make your own "nails" for the furniture   wow  
just reminds you how eastern culture is 10, 000 years older than western culture   i wonder how old these designs are 
真的太牛逼了你小小的身體到底哪來的力氣👏👏佩服佩服
子柒好棒！！！

好感动 想起来很小很小的时候，奶奶家请老篾匠来做竹凳子的情景……那时候觉得他们好厉害啊，学校附近有一家，我们经常看老人灵巧的双手编出各种农家用的东西，现在方圆几十里都没那种匠人了 
the title only said sofa  she is definately amazing, everything she does comes so naturaly as if she doesnt need to put any thought in it

minecraft work is easy but the real life work is difficult what do you think guys?

she is really something  amazing skills 
ikea   makes complicated furniture   the chinese girl  imma end this company’s career
ok what can't this lady do??? 😱  legend
i am so glad i stopped to watch this   makers are truly the same all over the world  their imagination, perseverance and craftsmanship is so satisfying to watch  and the filmmaking and storytelling is also superb    bamboo looks like such an amazing material   i wish i had a forest to gather my materials from   the only place i could ever find it when i was young was behind the carpet stores  the carpet was rolled on bamboo    today they just use paper or plastic or metal   i don’t know where one would find large bamboo in america for a project like this   i did not know it could be heat bent   something new i learned from this video   and my many thanks for the kind soul who provided the translation   i will surely smile every time i remember this video 
i wanna live that kind of life
me at 2 am  gotta sleep, exam at 7 am tomorrow      brain   yo dude how about we learned how to make bamboo sofa instead   ?
we know she don't live alone in a isolate place  with her grand mother    this is all made for youtube
chinese civilization is great, and the chinese people have preserved their ancient heritage over time, a people that deserves all respect
her grandmother must be so proud
that little "aha  " when she walked on top of the bench  3 47  so cute 💓💓

如果你會降龍十八掌  我也不會覺得意外耶     
who's still watching this wonderful set in 2020 ?
some people still don't know who she is  they said she is paid actress   come on guys   look at her hand   that's worker hands, not an actress' hand   🙂

彻底被折服了了了了了！！！！！！！！！！！！！！赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞赞
i need a woman like that she is very very special
i can't believe she did this without wearing gloves  the splinters   
めっちゃ美人さん    そしてカッコイイ   
damn, not only did she make her own furniture, but she also embroidered her pillows and sheets  and here i have a hard time understanding the instructions for an ikea product 
damn  this girl can do everything 😱 is she a human hahaha 
what can’t this young lady do?  the chinese culture is so beautiful 
it's mesmerizing to watch her confident skill, knowledge of materials, industriousness, artistic sensibility, versatility   imagination  she sets the high standard for being a person of substance   virtue  we can all learn a great deal from her by the pleasure she derives from simplicity   the fruits of her own labors  i, for one, am rethinking my own value system 
grandma  i like the chair on my neighbor's house  liziqi  say no more
strong independent woman without feminist personality  waifu material at it's best
beautiful, skilled, strong, and compassionate    what's not to like 
21,000+ people disliked this  excuse me, what? it's literally a person making a sofa out of bamboo 
чудо девушка золотые руки пример многим мужчинам 
ziqi  i could really use a nice sofa set for relaxing and tea time   proceeds to make a furniture set 
すげー！！竹だけでも家具が出来ること初めて知りました！ 竹箸は作ったことあるのですが 家具は作ったことないので  作ってみたいと思いました！！ほんとに凄い！！
i was very surprised when she heated up the bamboo and it bends around the pole  🤯 whoaaaaa  didnt know you can do that 
かっこいい こんな大作じゃなくてもいいから何か作りたくなってきた
i just love watching this lady   her warm heart, knowledge and skills  top marks from me

idk why this reminded me of "the tale of princess kaguya" 😅☹️
я б на такой женился бы не раздумывая  я и сам не лодырь, но в россии таких хозяюшек не найдешь
lovely  bamboo is such a versatile material  she makes this look easy and the results are so elegant 
采菊东篱下，悠然见南山。一个把文人骚客梦想变成现实的姑娘
🐕is the first time that see this video🇨🇳🌲🌵🌴 and think that you is a person amazing, congratulations from perú🇵🇪 whit all my heart ❤️
bravo c est vraiment beau      sophie france
таких девушек, хозяйственных нужно брать в жёны☝️ а не тех, которые ходят по танцполам, потреблядей 
a tight slap to those girls who says that dancing and doing makeup all day is feminism  
fak, she puts me and most ppl i know to shame by her skills    this is a wife to get, if we are having some kind of apocalypse, survival is highly likely with her 🤣
балакетища    она чудо женщина  нет слов, одни восхищения  май дрим, дрим, энд дрим 
sometimes when you see her hands from a close up looks like men's hands  i think that it looks like a production  who filmed her? who edit? she has different social media platforms, so is this real?? does she really do her make up?
she can literally make a whole living and i'm here starting off and accidentally getting scratches and cry in pain 
i saw it and l loved it
imagine being her neighbor and hearing the sounds of slashing at night and sharpening a knife 
malayalees undo
she looks like a freaking princess  a hardworking one  wow 
i almost cry  i remember that my family had a bamboo sofa just like the one that li ziqi made when i was a kid  i loved it very much and it was so cool and refreshing to sleep on  with the development of technology and economy  in china , we did not need it anymore since we've had air conditioners and fans everywhere, so one day  when it was 12 years ago or so  my granny decided to throw it away  i cried and begged her not to do that  she asked me "how would you deal with this big thing? it takes up too much space " i didn't know how to answer her  she threw it away two days later    i will always remember the bamboo sofa that accompanied my family for decades, and all the precious things disappeared in the modern society 
and here's my sister, who doesn't know how to fold bedsheet
bamboo, is one of four plant 'treasures' in chinese cultural traditions  it is strong , bend with the wind and does not break easily  it stays green in all four seasons  it has endless uses and applications in chinese daily life  what this girl did with bamboo is the embodiment of its treasury in chinese culture

i watched video, i got inspired, i tried, now pain in whole body    seriously guys it's not easy what it looks like in video     salute to ur hard work
now i understood why almost all things we used daily are "made in china"
you're a genius 
  god give you and your grandmother a long life 
看这个视频让我想起了小时候爷爷做的竹床，那时候还没有空调，夏天睡起来可凉快了。可惜时光如梭，他老人家已经不在了。希望他在另一个世界过的很好，不用受苦。
the video is perfect in everyway  how the video is shot not only capturing her talent but also the beautiful nature surrounding her  the background music is soo relaxing along with the sound of tool it's almost like an asmr video 10/10
seriously i could just watch her all day, skilled and beautiful 
this amazing woman is very proud of her culture and  traditions she is amazing
i love how she did not use metal nails in the furniture 
i'm about to turn 60  and i finally figured out, i want to be just like her 
granny do you think this nuclear power station i built is good?   wah, so nice 👏  hehe
for those who question her, ziqi was abandoned by her parents when she was born  she was adopted by a women but was not well treated  her grandparents finally took care of her however they are old  ziqi grew up alone and left home when she was 14  she did many jobs to survive and learned so many things  she was even a dj at some time   life is tough for her but she never gave up  however her grandmother was seriously sick so she decided to go back home and took care of her  luckily, her record of her life made her famous and gave her a better life  what a tough girl 
i see beautiful woman make furniture out of bamboo, i click, and immediately press like button, and subscribe   i dont know but i like something out of bamboo   and it is nice to see this video on recommendation
6 thousand dislikes ? why ?? 
this actually living minecraft 
it’s so beautiful  i’m too lazy to even do my dishes, but you’re making your own furniture  
she is so talented, disciplined, strong, and beautiful
after doin' all the hardwork she looks so calm,i sense the feeling of satisfaction     i mean ,how can she be so strong and extremely talented in everything she does? unbelievable this girl,just unbelievable       i wonder how    🤔🤔🤔
her hometown in sichuan, which is also the hometown for pandas  lol
not many people can appreciate living like this i was born in a rain forest, this is how we made our beds
wow    she just made a set of beautiful furniture in no time and in very skillful manner  i would have probably already died on the way to the forest to get the bamboo, mauled by a pissed off panda or something 
i’m scared of the dark when i sleep   but when i watch her on my bed in the dark   i feel safe for some reason😂😂
first time i feel like, didn't waste 6 46 minutes in youtube  nice work   👌👌
she is so beautiful as well as all her magnificent works      💘
美しい竹の椅子。感激です。　心洗われました。
most amazing diy furniture in the world by the most amazing woman  salute to her for doing everything from scratch 
she should have married with that guy who build everything with pool  😂
i've been watching your vids quite some time right now and girl    you're so calming and you carried those bamboos and i'm like "ohh, of course she does that"  and this life is exactly what i wish for  so peaceful   like i can sense positive energy from you to where i am now  like diys with nature, this connection of mind and soul thing is soooo calming  thanks for this vid  
looks like heaven is smiling on you, and you have the blessings of the ancestors   i am in awe 
the longer i stay in the city the more i want to go out and live a life like this
omg she can do everything  maybe even the world ends, she will survive on her own 
日本からのコメントです。美しい生活だと思いました。感謝します。ありがとう。家具を作るのは良いことです。☺️☺️👍👍👍
すごすぎる。手際良すぎるw
3 48 she sounds pleased that the frame is steady  it's so easy to forget she's not always a master of everything but she's also constantly learning  very inspirational 
當年第一次看，很感動。現在再看，感動依舊。
かっこいい！ 最後に着替えて寛ぐのもいい！
she's so beautiful  and my type of a perfect women  if she's taking good care of that furniture she's making imagine how she's gonna take care of you happy life  true   and making amazing thing's   because some lets say beautiful girls but so stupid don't know anything only shopping brushing there hair wasting time  
she was taught and she learned how to do things on her own, if this was a man no one will be wondering if he made all of that   my comment is made based on the backlash she has received over and over again
子柒好美哦，坐在那里或者站在那里都像画一样❤️
the bamboo clonking together sounds so soothing xd
啥都会 厉害。。我真怕她有一天盖房
ok what school did she go to?  that probs has alot classes and she did most of them  i cant do crap for life

this girl does not need ikea  ikea needs her 
amazing talented work that should be continually passed down to future generations, so that the beauty and skills of this art are never lost with time  that was a lot of hard work, but truly a stunning outcome 
the beauty inside her flows into everything she does 
speechless😢 no words can describe you liziqi💜 wish you a happy long life🙏
i'm not certain as to why this popped up on my recommend, however i thoroughly enjoyed every second of it 
she looks beautiful assembling a piece of furniture that she completely sourced from the forest   meanwhile i look like crap assembling pre made furniture from ikea 
i was planning on being productive today   youtube recommendations had other plans   
i am in love with this woman  all respect
然后我为了自己安装宜家的家具感到自豪。。。。
i finally understand why traditional chinese girls are so attractive 
all the thumbs down votes must have very sad lifes 
this is an insanely beautiful video   i didn’t know bamboo was so good to work with   
she’s beautiful and does work with pride  need more people like that 
im alway waiting for her videos like a kid waiting for a candy   😍
man, whoever marrying her is the luckiest guy in the world 
little woman but she’s strong 💪🏻 can do everything 👏🏻
may the god bless her mightily and fulfill all her needs
her  knows how to make furniture out of bamboo   me  can barely make my bed 
the fact that you can do all these things and make it look effortless with grace is beyond me  you're amazing 💯
i clicked because the girl in the thumbnail looked so pretty and familiar to me  idk her, but she is so impressive  strong and beautiful woman 👍👏❤
太无敌了，秒杀太多自以为是女神的女神。。。。
ancient chinese people almostly didn't trade because like this way they could make things themselves，such an example
bamboo is amazing  let’s utilize it in every way that we can 
im so glad youtube recommended me this girl <3
lei è molto brava signorina
i'm sure she knows kungfu    i just know it  
i don’t get why there are disliking     i mean i can’t even carry one bamboo 😩, and i bet the people who dislike it can’t either 🙄 
beauty, talent, courage,hardworking women everything that a man could imagine of is in her
that is one smart, tough, wonderful, and beautiful young lady   i gave up my man card to her a long time ago, when i watched her make an awesome outdoor swing/lounge/love seat/bed       those are some really nice furniture pieces  i want to take a nap on the lounge so bad         thank you, 李子柒, so much for your wonderful videos  best wishes

这个女人是一颗真正的珍珠  美丽，聪明      而且非常勤奋。  恭喜      美丽的珍珠！
真是太厲害了佩服佩服 但是 影片中的您可能花了10年以上的功夫 我們身在台灣 好的竹子也越來越少 像這種竹子加工 幾乎快要失傳了 沒有人重視 僅存的師父 都是以男性為主的七八十歲老師傅 竹子加工很 容易受傷 根本沒有人願意學 這段影片中的 作品 極為優秀 令我有很深的感觸
leñadora, carpintera, modista    ¿hay algo quw esta mujer no pueda hacer? excelente trabajo  
me  gustan tus vídeos  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this whole video is just beautiful and so satisfying
我是來自台灣的粉絲 我非常的欣賞妳 年紀輕輕就有如此才華與才能 妳很懂得生活 把現實生活過的如此的安逸恬靜 很羨慕妳 加油 給妳多個讚唷我還會持續關祝你的 
来了好多老外。。。呵呵
for english speakers the title says   to add some fresh greenness to life ,making an bamboo sofa 
一看我家子柒女侠扛捆着四五米长的毛竹就好解气！
看來外國朋友也愛上子柒了 找不到中文評論🤣
she inspired me to shoot a video of my mother   love from vietnamese 
shes out here having entire sentence convos with her viewers in the video title
i’m pretty sure she’s a disney princess
me  struggles with putting together an ikea furniture  ziqi  grows her own cotton to make her grandmother a mattress  she wins at life 
wtf she made a mattress    this woman can do literally everything
the fact that she has almost 11m subs and she doesn’t start her vids with “whats up guys smash that like button ”
she is not a talker, she is a doer       her video should be put in the formal education systems too
she made a frickin pillow for the dog, this woman is a goddess
the old traditional tools she uses for making mattress from cottons are very rare nowadays in china, but they were quite common in old rural china households  i don't think you can find any of those tools in other countries 
your life style is just like a poem and a beautiful song 
let's sign a petition to disney to make a princess character inspired from her who doesn't need a prince charming for her survival  this will be a massive hit
“the life of” is a great way to begin the title your videos 
what she does, its extremly important to this world, and its one of the things thats makes internet and youtube worth 
子柒把中國农村的真實农作及平凡的日常生活展示的如此美麗！中國的文化之美就是如此自然清新！只有有心之人才能去发觉體會中國文化之美！
wow   you have just put most men in the west to shame 😆 including myself  blimey  well done 👍
dude  marry me i'll provide for you her  with what?
that red coat her grandma is wearing looks so comfy and warm, like you're wearing a quilt  no doubt she made it for her grandma 
she is incredible  she's an inspiration to all of us
this is the first time i saw how to processing cotton at home and i'm so amazed by the results😍🤩
is there anything she can't do?  her talent is on another level

золушка в сравнении с этой  красавицей, вообще никакая, здоровья такой нации с такими девушками, хороший проэкт 
she made a blanket for the dog i'm crying
просто нет слов    потрясающе    😇🙏 где такому учатся   это просто состояние души   полет души 
супер канал девушка молодец    и красиво гармония     и полезно забытые или новые для меня знания    такое время может пригодится     я желаю всем счастья    🌿🌹🌹🌹🌿
in my 50+, this video bringing me back to the memory of my 10 years old  thank you  
awh man i wish i lived somewhere like that, looks so calm and humble 
me  struggles with putting together an ikea furniture  ziqi  grows her own cotton to make her grandmother a mattress  she wins at life 
she is so patient      its make me have more strive in life  thank for updating the video
хочу туда повторить весь этот опыт с момента посадки до момента создания вещей
me after 5 mins of this video  i wanna go live with her and do all these things   me at the end of video   realises i'm a lazy ass 
she's the duvet cover "queen", a lot of love went into the making of that duvet blanket, grandmother taught her well 
watching her do all those things makes me feel like a useless and lazy human being 
i simply adore these videos of this wonderful women doing all the tasks as she would have 100 years ago the food and building basic structure is so awesome much ahroha  love  from new zealand
she always thinks about others before her even if it is a animal 
this life is more beautiful than standing at the phone all day and having no friends
can you imagine how long this 11 minutes vid take her to film?? damn impressed
incredible how she does everything with love   she has a good heart   increíble como hace todo con amor   ella tiene buen corazón 
i died at the part where the dog cuddled into the blanket she made for them it was so cute 😭
i want to go there with your place so i can learn even how to plant and live with my own sweat just like you always shown in your video 
респект и уважение, здоровья вам с семьёй 👍👍👍🌹🌹🌹🌹
anybody else get teary eyed when she gave her dog a doggy bed? i love her so much  she doesn't know me but i love her and i wish many good fortunes to follow and bless her and her family 
she knows a lot about chinese and she is also very beautiful she create video’s about her making things and that’s really great  she makes clothes, foods and more for the grandparents 
i actually have a cotton stuffed blanket that is made that exact same way  when you take it out of its casing you can see all the crisscrossing threads  it's super warm and somehow still breathable  my parents and i brought it with us when we immigrated to canada 15 years ago and it's served me well for many, many winters across multiple provinces 
красавица  трудяга  дай вам бог всего самого хорошего   
how is it possible to dislike someone who is working so hard ? it’s such a peaceful life she’s living 
здорово  вот она её  величество жизнь 
это прекрасно    а девушка волшебница    
нет, это не девушка, а чудо какое то 😁 собаки, и те спят под одеялом  это ж надо так любить всех  👍
well now i feel like the laziest person on earth 
i love to see grandma she looks so proud of her grand daughter  so much love and kindness in her eyes 
ความคิดสร้างสรรค์มากเยี่ยมเลย 👍👏
her  plants seeds  me  wow her  replants seeds  me  wow her cut seeds m  wow h picks cotton m  wow h  makes cotton flower arrangement  m  wow her  makes cotton mattress pad with bamboo and string  m 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
класс ты большая молодец  ✿ ♡‿♡ 
what a wonderful woman i never seen in this world  she's busy every minute
giving the dog a blanket was the loveliest part  my heart melted 
what a cute dog  the original way of life feels beautiful 
i wonder how often does she make a mattress? i mean, for her to remember the delicate details, it's amazing  i do the same things daily n still manage to forget this n that 
i’m amazed   i honestly have no words 
i think some people might think, “why is she spending so much time doing that, when she can just buy it?” the point is sometimes making something yourself and living a simple life with the feeling of having all the time in the world is actually a luxury  it’s like doing a puzzle or meditating, except you get to enjoy the end result   3
我想离开美国。能够像你一样生活
how does she stay so clean? whenever i work in the garden i look like an actual pig 
she has a good land  she is so hard working  she can do all these magical things like a disney princess  god bless her❤️
watching her do all those things makes me feel like a useless and lazy human being 
what a calm loving show and goddesses  education of gaia growth abilities ♥️🚰😆
soubhanallah from a cotton to a blanket  imagine if everyone do this in his garden, we can reduce the pollution of their factories  please, we can all change the world, as a  teenager, last year i planted some beans, tomatoes, but they died, but the avocado and the pine tree are growing, i hope inchallah our garden will be the best  and why? because the climate changing motivated me  hope peoples will change 😘🤲🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
i just love how she has such a large overview of time, to be able to film things weeks, months and, sometimes, years ahead just so she can put them togther at the end  makes me wonder what marvels she has in her video vault just waiting for the right time to finish and share with us lucky folk 
estou encantada com os vídeos  são muito inspiradores  vejo a glória do senhor em cada planta, às sementes germinando    coisa linda  parabéns
this is incredible  💖👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 what an amazing way of living  beautiful skill 
li ziqi  grows cotton, mends cotton tools, makes bedding so grandma can rest comfortably  even the pup gets a bed  so talented, so nice 😍
beautifully created and with such generosity too xx sending hugs and much love across the water to you 🤗❤️
it didn't hit me until i saw her lay the cotton mattress on her grandmother's bed, she worked so hard for so many hours so many days into the night tirelessly weaving and sewing to make a cozy warm mattress for her grandmother and it brought me to tears how selfless and hardworking she really is and how i wish i could be like that
i love your videos, and it’s very comfortable to watch them, you’re very strong and peaceful, thanks for showing and share with us 
the fact she took the time to also make one for the pupper    she gets an instant get into heaven card  what a classy lady  this is what i call class  not dolled up, not trying hard to be something she’s not, providing, caring  beautiful inside and out  class act 
原来弹棉花是这样的啊
americans  "the chinese eat cats and dogs  they hate animals " li zi qi   makes a cotton bed from raw materials for her pup so he wouldn't be cold 
какая красивая и трудолюбивая девушка щеночка тоже утеплила , олеяльце ей сделала из хлопка 
i still have this childhood memory of my mom taking our cotton beddings to the craftsman’s workshop and let them add more layers  i can still visualize their movements of doing it   that’s how we survived the humid and severe winter with no heat in central china  now my hometown is urbanized so fast and those workshops are nowhere to see, our beddings have come from these old schooled cotton to modern mattress  thank you liziqi for her beautiful skills to reperform traditional agricultural life style  it’s a memory we asians, as well as humans share together  it’s a history we shall respect and not being oblivious of 
i'm from chengdu, china "liziqi" and i are 200km apart, we are both the same age, the content in her video is all the real things that we can get in touch with when we were young, but it takes too much time to make  in china, most people born in the 1980s have such experience, and she reminds me all the time how incompetent i am  ha ha ha  you are the pride of sichuan and china 
you are so amazing, you can do all things perfectly, love your skills and commitment the life of cotton well demonstrated love it 
wow imagine having talent and knowledge
this lady grew the damn cotton picked it, processed it, fluffed it, weaved a net for it, and stuffed inside all to make a new mattress for her grandmother and her dogs to sleep comfortably   my god this woman is amazing
she is a talented woman, yes   but she also has a huge heart 
佩服 非常有深度跟能力的網紅
the time when she rubbed and relaxed her wrist   i felt that pain 🙁god bless her ❤

 feb 20, 2020 最近春种，加上奶奶不是最近老毛病又有点发了嘛！老七就在家一边干活一边陪奶奶。白天干活一边跟旁边看着她干活的奶奶说说家常，煮各种好吃的。晚上跟奶奶一起看会儿电视然后睡觉。加上她自己前几年剪片子熬夜熬的太厉害，所以也想小休息一下调整下作息，也好好陪奶奶。看到私信很多人问更新的事情，我们大家就再给她多放小半把月的假吧！

please dont change the name of the series  i love it 
this channel is the best accident that ever happened to me 
one of the real life mulan in this world   
💖💖translation from liziqi's comments💖💖   又是一个“一生”系列，谷雨前后开拍的。
 it's "one life" series again   it means a long time span  started at about april 20th, 2019  
 小时候还经常看到我家这边有种棉花
 长大之后再也没见过了
 就是没人种了
 那时候家旁边有个大晒坝
 晒坝旁边就有将近1亩地的棉花
 开花的时候漂亮极了！
 白的 粉的花朵随风摇曳
 我做作的棉花田里赏花，
 还假装自己很美的样子～～～
 现在看来，至少这一点我还是没变的！！
 
when i was a child, i often saw cotton growing in the field near my house  but i don't see it when i grew up   at that time, there was a big drying dam beside the house, and there was a nearly 600 ㎡ cotton field beside the drying dam   cotton blossomed beautifully, with white and pink flowers swaying in the wind  😊  i enjoyed flowers in the cotton field, and i felt that i‘m beautiful too, and i thought i haven't changed that till now   😉   今年试着种了一下，
 网上买的种子
 担心品种原因种不了就买了几个品种
 结果还好都有出芽，
 只是移栽那段时间我忙别的耽搁了
 困了苗子，
 导致最后生长情况很差
 但好在也是有点收获。
 for memorizing, i planed to grow cotton, and then i bought cotton seeds online   i bought several types of cotton because i was afraid that some of them may not suitable for growing in this climate   fortunately, cotton blossomed later   but later, i was busy with other things during the transplanting period, which led to the poor growth of cotton  😫  finally, and fortunately, there is also a little harvest  not so much   😅 
 摘回来的棉花要晾晾去水汽
 然后就是去籽
 小时候还能找到去棉籽专用的木头梳花机
 但现在都没有了
 所以只能靠手
 一颗颗摘肯定是摘到过年都摘不完
 想了个办法
 用梳羊毛的梳子来梳掉棉花籽
 比梳花机慢，但也比手摘要快很多很多。
 4斤棉花估摸着多半天
 the picked cotton should be dried to remove water vapor and then be seeded   when i was a child, i saw a special machine for removing cottonseed, but now it is gone, so i could only remove impurities by hand   if you pick one by one by hand, you can't finish it until the spring festival  😑  then i figured out a way to comb the cotton seeds with a wool comb  😜  it's slower than a machina, but it's much faster than a manual summary   it took about half a day to finish 2kg of cotton  
 棉籽和杂质去掉后就准备拉线
 这个就是棉絮的包裹网
 要均匀密实的包裹住弹好的棉花
 所以要各种拉，
 按顺序横拉竖拉做格子，
 大经拉完拉小线，
 左右横竖通通拉一遍
 最后还得拉大线经纬固定
 线拉好就可以弹棉花了
 first of all, fix the cotton thread, and then start to strike cotton         the description of making process, it's hard to translate😅 i'm sorry     
 我弹棉花这个工具大概都20多年
 很久很久没人用过
 木头风化 竹条也断的差不多了
 this tool is about 20 years old, and no one has used it for a long time   the wood is weathered, and the bamboo bars are almost broken  
 修修补补好一阵子
 剁竹条的时候还被飞起来的竹棍子戳到鼻子
 打磨打磨装上新牛筋弦还可以用
 i spent a lot of time repairing this tool, during which my nose was hurt because of the flying bamboo stick when i cut the bamboo  😢😢  4 52   finally, it was polished and could be continued to be used with new tendon strings  
 去掉棉籽的棉花还用棍子打松以后才能弹
 棉花太死不容易弹开，会缠在弦上
 越弹越紧
 but, remember that the cotton can only be fluff after it is loosened with a stick, because the cotton is too tight to be easily bounced off and will be wrapped on the string  and getting tighter and tighter    
 弹棉花真的是力气活！
 这个一点不夸张，比让我背几十斤粮食还费劲
 我小时候就是天天围着我姑父看他弹棉花
 没亲自操作过，
 这次给奶奶做棉絮才正儿八经的提前学了两天
 太费劲了
 木头10来斤，
 还有木槌拉扯牛筋弦的力道
 这个受力基础上还要保持平衡把棉花弹松
 左右手都要同时发力保持和谐
 要是能找到这个老物件你们可以感受感受，，， fluffing cotton is really hard work  😅  it's no exaggeration to say that it's more difficult to do this than to carry tens of kilograms of grain on my back  😱  when i was a child, i surrounded my uncle every day to see him fluff cotton  but i didn't operate it myself   this time, i wanted to operate it myself  i learned two days in advance, and want to make a quilt for my grandma 💖  it's too hard  because the wood is more than 5 kg, and i have to hit the string hard, and to keep balance while i'm fluffing cotton   by the way, if you can find such a old machina, you can try it yourself 😜   虽然现在机器做的被子又好又暖和，但就是想矫情的给她亲手做一床，听说我要给她弹棉絮她多高兴啊，我做棉被她一直围着我们转来转去，一直喊着要来帮忙哈哈。 心里吧，多少还是不一样的，，
 although the quilt made by the machine is nice and warm now, i want to make a quilt for my grandma by myself   when she heard that i was going to make her a quilt, she was so happy 
  at that time, when i was fluffing cotton, she was always around me and said she wanted to help me hahaha 😂
  i think it was very meaningful 
 
 最后给锅仔也做了个小被子
，它之前都没有专门的被子，就是一件旧棉衣，要过年了给它也顺带做一个新被子，将就着还有剩的棉花  finally, i made a quilt for guozai name of the dog , because there was no special quilt before, only an old cotton padded jacket for her 
 now it's time to make a new quilt for guozai 😋
 
 
 又不知道写啥了
，就这样吧，冬天冷，还是那句唠叨了很多次的话，不要感冒，一定注意保暖。强行么么哒！  so   it's very cold these days   i hope you keep warm  and take good care of yourselves  love you  😘😘🥰🥰  （translated from liziqi's comments in bilibili）
棉花太可爱了
i hope she’s okay, with everything going on in china right now  be safe, we love you 
è meraviglioso guardarti   love from italy
she lost her parents when we was kid and lived with her grandmother till now, lot’s people was questioning how she manage life looks so easy, here is the answer   she was doing it when she was kid and choose live with grandma now because she is her only loved once, i’m chinese so i have read her background 
honestly the biggest respecc moment is  she has to be like filming her everyday life, most of it, for a long time so you just get a lot of footage sitting around  and then she has to compile and pull together probably hours or footage from over like half a year into one video, and continue to do that consistently for different topics  shit really do add up yo, everyday you dont see progress and it's just a bunch of small things but at the end you really do get a bigass harvest  and that's how she's compiling these vids  mad respecc 
qué maravilloso video, un ejemplo de dedicación y trabajo  felicidades a esa mujer ejenplar ❤️🌷
how nice the little guilt she made for her little dog  "i would a new guilt for you as the cny it is approaching", she said to the dog, and she made one for her  wish i could be the dog under that nice guilt in her home     “弹棉花”  tan mian hua  fluffing cotton , is a job in which has been fading out in china  it was a skillful job conducted by the strong  and skillful men   the instruments includes an about 1m long wooded stick, an about 1 2m long bamboo bend with a   2 4m depends   string  normally made of a refined leather because of elastic and tenacious   and a wooden club   the worker has a belt on his waist and the one side of the stick through on the back the bamboo bend is hocked on the another side of the stick and the left hand hold the bend with the string down  how to work  left hand hold the bend with string move back and forth, up and down to the cotton, meanwhile the right holds the wooden club keeping playing the string  the string jumping like spring up and down on the cotton of which the way to fluff the cotton from the big mass into a piece of feather      it mainly operates in the countryside, some people had no piece no land or some of them had poor economy from the land, whatever the reasons  the work literally documents in yuan dynasty 1271 1368 which means the existence long before that  in the past, the demand of fluffing cotton normally occurred in the later autumn or winter because the farming were done and people became to prepare something for their families, new cloth, shoes and new guilt  that was the season for fluffing cotton to make something  at that moment of planned economy, very few people would be able pay for cash  many of them paid with grains, a piece of meat, or half fish or some eggs or some sugar     nowadays, it has totally gone from many chinese people's life as we are at the industrialization  ziqi's video gives us a study of common knowledge from a seed of cotton of how the cotton grows up and what does it looks like and the way of cotton have become a guilt  it is an education  it does not warm her granny, her dog and it warms us, the audiences of the world  thank you very much, ziqi for sharing with us   happy chinese new year  all the best for the descriptions  it is 8 37 million  jumping over 1 billion in the year of rat

3 18 puppies    🥰💗
this young woman is a true super hero  she is selfless, beautiful, and watching her fills me with such love and joy  she is amazing 
she said to her grandma   dear grandma, take care of yourself and keeping warm   have a good night  to her dog   i am going to make a quilt for you
once upon a time, there lived a princess named  李子柒 liziqi   i was inspired by her to film my mother for my channel   
don't change the name of the series,  it's perfect as it is  you named it and let it stays that way   if people don't like it,  that's their problem  lot of love 
какая же милая  и трудолюбивая девушка, сейчас таких не встретишь
девушка очень красивая, да ещё и умница 
she spent two years for only this 11 mins, love those who respect their life and work, by the way i miss my home town guilin very much i can't wait to go back
im sorry but why 9 k of dislike??? u there at home watching this video are u able to do 1  of what she does?? that’s not fair, the hard work she put on it 
is no one gonna bring up the adorable puppies? especially the one at the end😁
the grandma must be so happy that she raised such a good granddaughter 😊😍❤️

after watching her videos, suddenly i'm doing what i do with more conviction   if not, its easy to procrastinate and not have the motivation to really do everyday living stuff with a sense of accomplishment 
i hope you guys can have a look at my words   as far as i know, liziqi has been trying her best to find channels for materials these days  so far, at least 40,000 medical masks, 20,000 pairs of medical gloves and 1000 protective clothing have been donated by liziqi   she is too tired, so she has no mood and energy to update the videos  i hope you guys can understand her    up to now, the coronavirus has been clearly controlled, the number has been declining continuously, and it is expected to be completely solved in march   pay homage to liziqi and all the virus fighters 
me need bed  go buy  liziqi  plant cotton seeds
好原始的生活喔！
i love the red sweater with hearts that the granny wears  🥰
is there anything this lady cannot make?  she is so amazing   her grandparents taught her well 
she is the strongest woman that i have ever seen with multi skills from the engineer, landscaper and chef  big love from me 👍
this is the girl we all dreamed to be as a child 
зачем такие сложности??? ужас   и это ради не очень теплого одеяла??  почему не овечья шерсть??? или пух птиц???   все проще и быстрее    ролики красивые   
i actually teared up when you made her dog a mini comforter 
 very talented and caring person, nice vlog  i also watch   mandeepvlogs  jalandharhaweli  super nice vlogs about punjabi culture by a very talented, hard working and pleasant person 
i wish there was a “love” button  it was so heartwarming when she made the cotton mattress topper for her grandma and then she even made a blanket for the dog 🥰
looks like her grandpa  when was alive taught her much, respect for her grandpa  n grandma who raised her w/ love n care 👍🏼👍🏼   n she is good granddaughter also   btw i love look her cute puppies 🐕🐕😍🤩
i love her, she is such a hardworking and brave woman that can do almost everything,please support her more especially now since there are lots of bad comments about  her  also loved how she purposely made the dog a nicer and cozier blanket    so sweet
omg  the description 💕💕💕she didn't had a good harvest but she's grateful to have enought to make mattress for her granny💕💕💕
please be careful outside, may you and your entire community be safe from the virus
when she made the blanket for the dog 🥰🥰
i cry to see how she love her grandma and her pets 😭😭😭
真本事假不了你是我看過最用心做視頻的人，佩服
she is very hard working girl  i am totally impressed  very good
that's what i love about china  wow 
i love that she took time to make bed for her dog  that was jus lovely ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
she appreciates all the beauty and love surrounding her  that's why she makes heaven a living reality  and plus, she's so skillful and resourceful, not to mention, also so beautiful  i just admire her so much 
what an amazing woman  why the dislikes?? there should be zero dislikes for all she does  the ending was adorable❤❤ love watching all of your videos❤❤❤
this makes me realize how much stress we live under  with school, drama, friends, grades, just go outside for a little and weave yourself a flower crown  breath  the world may do many things to you, but if you can appreciate what the world does best, it will give it to you  all we worry about is the drama, the grades, the work, the pressure, the "trying to be best at something" thingy, but deep down we don't depend on that to survive  look around, and whenever you feel discouraged or left out, just try something new  breath in and out, in and out  appreciate what the world has given you 
i can only wish to have even just an inch of her skills 
that must have taken 300 years to make
when she tucked her puppy in, i remembered when i used to tuck my dog in every night and kiss her to bed  but she passed away in april  i’ll love her til death  hugs from italy 🇮🇹
dear li laoshi  we are all hoping and praying for you and your grandmother and everyone else in china to be safe and healthy in this new year 
ziqi  is okay ,don't worry, because of the virus ,ziqi stop updating, she is working on donation now for the virus ,  as you know , the most important thing in china now is fighting the virus ,  she will update soon ,
just when you think you've seen everything,  she suprises you with a new talent   this lady is full of  love and great talents  she deserves all the kindness and love in return ♥️♥️♥️ from canada
i pray that everything will be okay with her and her granny during this darkest time in china  been waiting for her video but that's okay her and her granny's safety is priority  let's pray she and her granny is fine 
i wish we'd been taught useful stuff like this when we were growing up, in school   instead of having to sit through hours of useless crap, in which we had no interest  with skills like this one is independent, self reliant this is why they don't teach it in schools 
she is a very talented and hard working girl with a big heart in loving and caring for people and animal around her💕   alway look forward to her new video😍
ваши видио как мантра для души даже мотивирует и дает энергию 👍👍👍
one of strongest feelings i have when watching ziqi’s videos is this life style can become a therapy for depression  one gets too busy for depression  and every outcome becomes rewarding and appreciated  after following her series, i myself became more diligent, and complaining less about daily chores and labor  thank you ziqi 
老家还有老铺子有这个手艺，拜托老妈帮我订了这样做出来的一床棉被，期待
she is soooooo crazy clever girl and the part that it makes her stand out in my own opinion is, her love for her grandmother   this alone will lead her to more blessing in her life ahead  great gift for a grandmother  is a loving granddaughter 👏👏👏💜 
long cứu mình thích xem thank you hi
she is quite famous now  and she always donates a lot of money to schools 
she just made a mattress without using any technology and with her bare hand  i stan 
i’m impressed  my lazy butt laying in bed breathing hard like i was the one doing all that hard word   
if you want something to be good, make it yourself
she's not just can do everything, but she's professional in everything 
аист в плохом месте гнездо не вьет  всех благ этому дому

omg   she just stole my heart, taking care of her grandmother and then the way she careful made and put the blanket around the old dog    thank you for sharing  ❤
all the people who disliked this video are the problem with this world  no appreciation for anything  i am thoroughly impressed with her hand making skills  very interesting and beautiful 
omg she made a blanket for the dog because it was cold😭😖
好勤劳的美女👍
不可思議
i love how that vase is always filled with what she brings inside her home  flowers in makeup video  and now cotton  it feels symbolic,     and also gentle  like time shown in a frame, slowly but surely changing, little by little  it's peaceful   
涨见识了，原来旧时候棉花是这么弹的。
وين العـرب "☻"  "﴿مـريـم﴾❥" بنت العـراق "👋💔🙂"
who wants to watch her videos every day like me
她真的很优秀，但是我的妻子在我心里是最优秀的
this young lady is fascinating, her skill at some of the ancient ways of living life, making her clothing, making her own furniture, her incredible gardens, and her total devotion to her grandmother   she is obviously super intelligent, hardworking, caring, and to top it off she is beautiful  always waiting for her next video 
my cute youtuber lizipi   😊
she does all this work yet still manages to look like a princess 
she kinda reminds me of mulan  like she is an independent girl who can achieve many things 
me  i need a new blanket  going to ikea  lizqi  hold my machete 🤷
the most awsome woman in this crazy world  take care
すごい。
oh  lord how much patience is needed for this  she is a miracle

какая же ты прелесть  и бабушке и собачке   в конце аж слеза вышла      
又是一个“一生”系列 谷雨前后开拍的。  小时候还经常看到我家这边有种棉花 长大之后再也没见过了 就是没人种了 那时候家旁边有个大晒坝 晒坝旁边就有将近1亩地的棉花 开花的时候漂亮极了！ 白的 粉的花朵随风摇曳 我做作的棉花田里赏花， 还假装自己很美的样子～～～ 现在看来，至少这一点我还是没变的！！  今年试着种了一下， 网上买的种子 担心品种原因种不了就买了几个品种 结果还好都有出芽， 只是移栽那段时间我忙别的耽搁了 困了苗子， 导致最后生长情况很差 但好在也是有点收获。  摘回来的棉花要晾晾去水汽 然后就是去籽 小时候还能找到去棉籽专用的木头梳花机 但现在都没有了 所以只能靠手 一颗颗摘肯定是摘到过年都摘不完 想了个办法 用梳羊毛的梳子来梳掉棉花籽 比梳花机慢，但也比手摘要快很多很多。 4斤棉花估摸着多半天  棉籽和杂质去掉后就准备拉线 这个就是棉絮的包裹网 要均匀密实的包裹住弹好的棉花 所以要各种拉， 按顺序横拉竖拉做格子， 大经拉完拉小线， 左右横竖通通拉一遍  最后还得拉大线经纬固定 线拉好就可以弹棉花了  我弹棉花这个工具大概都20多年 很久很久没人用过 木头风化 竹条也断的差不多了  修修补补好一阵子 剁竹条的时候还被飞起来的竹棍子戳到鼻子 打磨打磨装上新牛筋弦还可以用  去掉棉籽的棉花还用棍子打松以后才能弹 棉花太死不容易弹开，会缠在弦上 越弹越紧  弹棉花真的是力气活！ 这个一点不夸张，比让我背几十斤粮食还费劲 我小时候就是天天围着我姑父看他弹棉花 没亲自操作过， 这次给奶奶做棉絮才正儿八经的提前学了两天 太费劲了 木头10来斤， 还有木槌拉扯牛筋弦的力道 这个受力基础上还要保持平衡把棉花弹松 左右手都要同时发力保持和谐 要是能找到这个老物件你们可以感受感受，，，               ——by liziqi     bilibili
this is the most industrious woman i've ever seen 
the reason why she has long time no updating, is because her grandma is sick, so she needs to take good care of her grandma first  also, she is recovering and taking a long break, make sure everything fine, hopefully her grandma get well soon  and she might be back in few days   
she’d be the only person to survive in the apocalypse
привет из москвы   🌿🌹🌹🌹🌿
اني ركزت بس علا جماله 😭
i feels so useless right now  that is one hell of a woman  damn
who r liking to stay in this place
i know, i know, some of you are just too mesmerized by her and not watching what she's doing  for me, i needed to watch the video mulitple times  1st time in awe, have never seen anything like this before  mouth wide open   2nd time, i begin to notice the span of time this project took   the change of seasons, and change in her clothings  3rd time, i studied her contraptions, which are worn and needed repair  so i deduced she does not do this project often, or at least not recently  yet why is she so good at it ? she works on everything with such confident gusto  i floss my teeth everyday for 40yrs and have not figured out what length to use  4th time, i re  watched my favorite parts   grandma, and the puppies  5th time, i truely appreciated the cinematography of this entire video   always remembering that she's not only the actor, she's the producing and editor  how she anticipates when to zoom in and out, even for the same scene, plus aerial view, and sound mix between ambient and music, and always giving viewers and unexpected 5 10sec of heartwarming treats at the end  science and art beautifully woven  well done, lzq  thank you 
кандай керемет қыз 🙋‍♀️❤😍😍
子柒好厲害，支持妳！
when you can’t even make your own bed and she is literally making her own bed   my mother may be ashamed of me xd
i love how she just handed the puppy to the grandmother i dunno i found that so cute 💞
isn't great she love grandmother a lot she wants a soft bed and she made for her hats of this girl she also love her animals a lot she is so telanted absoulty incridable
liziqi  uploaded a video me  cancel everything
she is such a responsible girl  i really appreciate her for all the works she hav done  she is great 
liziqi   just wanted to send my best wishes   i hope that all of you are safe from the corona virus   my heart and prayers are with the chinese people, and all the others suffering from this   much love and respect from the usa 
petition for liziqi to make a grand tour
i am sure i am not the only one who genuinely wishes that liziqui was my next door neighbour and best friend  her caring nature for everyone and everything around her knows no boundaries, and her desire to learn and acquire so many ancient crafts  which all too easily could be lost in the modern world  is endless  the sheer time and effort which liziqui goes to when completing all these tasks is beyond astounding  a beautiful young woman with an abundance of talent and a whole encyclopaedia of knowledge  the western world has much to learn from this precious soul 
😟😮😲😱😱😱😱 that womam is incredibily capable, i want one like she 🤩😍😍😍
i will never look at my cotton quilts the same way again, so much work to make one  although mine must be made by machines , still, it makes me appreciate this daily stuff much more now  thanks for the education, ziqi ❤❤
thinking of all the chinese people at this frightening time  lizique, grannie and friends stay safe and well  love from another grannie in scotland
干活特麻利，一看就不是做秀
me  scrubbing my face with cotton while watching  me  look at the cotton in my hand  "each cotton has its own story" 
i’m extremely impressed by her   she’s the most hard working woman i’ve ever seen such a proud
all the dislikes are from people that buy lemon juice in the bottle because they can’t even squeeze it themselves 
love from india ❤️
now, some people accuse ziqi,s  videos of being “fake” and too far away from real life  but think about it  we know for a fact that star wars is “fake,” we know superman is “fake,” we know pretty much all movies are “fake” in that regard  but it doesn’t stop us from enjoying a good movie  li ziqi is extremely creative  she presents everything with an artistic touch, and the end result is simply amazing  is it exactly how she lives her life now? maybe not  but even if it’s a dream, it’s a beautiful dream built on real life 
очаровательно 
she is the kind of girl that can make a home comfortable, and secure 
liziqi ❤️❤️❤️
her hand was hurt while making the mattress but she continued weaving for her grandmother  i wish to achieve such high level of dedication 
спасибо большое вам за видео 👍👍👍🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💖💖💖💖
this women is really ausome
i cried at the end when she made a blanket for the puppy 
me  i want a cotton blanket   li ziqi  you need to start planting cotton trees first
she is really a genius  when i was a child i saw “professionals” touring to towns before every cny to make quilts like that for families  it is really strength and energy taking as you can see from the video, and i’d never seen a woman doing that  now the skill has disappeared for so many years and she is doing that as a young lady 
i love how simple her life is  i feel relaxed watching her videos and it made me realize how toxic office life is  some of us dreams of living in a luxurious home but her way living is what i've always wanted
this is a whole new level of “make from scratch “ lol
acho que ela come esses cachorros  todo video tem um diferente
her grandmother's knowledge is blooming through her   sometimes in life you don't achieve your goals but god, allaah in arabic, helps you achieve them through your offsprings  she is now a global icon 
creators like her by spending such a length time and puttimg on great effort to make few minutes of video, are making youtube experience alive  and those puppies gives the extra points to this video  😊👍😊
goosebumps all over again when i was child around 20years ago we used to have such some cotton trees in our field and my grandmother use to do such cotton works but with different tools/methods and i remember once i made small kind of tool for her and she used to tell stories about her younger times about  weaving cotton  such a hard work now the technologies has changed a lot in the last 2decades this make me remember old times my grandmother once againlove from nepal tq for your hard work and dedication  li ziqi 💕💕💕
the look on her grandma's face  she must be so proud of her, that she learnt all these traditions and can still do it correctly  love 😍😍😍
when she cuddles up that puppy and it was so sleepy and cute  heartmelting
завораживающее зрелище,оторваться не могу   
i pray that she, her grandma, and her pets never get hurt or sick  they're sweet 
the nine thousands of people who disliked this video shame on you🥺
你好朋友。看武汉的新闻。哭着为你祈祷。我们都是人类。祝您家人健康，力量和耐心。俄罗斯爱你。⚘
ох і праця тяжка,але ж одіяльце м'якеньке вийшло 
не деген енбек👍  колынан келмейтини жок екен 
mom  make your bed  me  sigh     liziqi  ok, you mean literally right
why is nobody talking about those cute dogs?
very much adorable when she makes something for her grandma n tommy as well with her own hands  the way she puts on doggy is so carefully and love  heart feeling 
супер  красота  красота 
the best part of this is how she's embraced her roots   culture wholeheartedly and unabashedly  if i could i'd go back to sweden, have a farm, some kids and live quietly and simply  for now i'll do my best to replicate that where i am    
she's making her grandma a mattress 
after watching this and given the fact i have always enjoyed living at the village, helping out my grandparents, growing our own food and herding the livestock  i am going back soon as i complete my studies
картины оживают в темноте 🌈 это надо видеть, заходите на канал😉 подписывайтесь🔔❤ за 🎥спасибо 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
i just can't figure out, how could a woman like this is real  every single one of her video is just so soothing, i start to cry when i realize that i'm abroad alone and that i miss my country so much    thank you li ziqi, thank you 
整个过程记录的非常详细，完整。的确是我国民间一直流传的种植，筛选、制作的过程演习。而且影片制作的非常有艺术感，让人非常喜欢。
she is so genius and a hard worker
fun fact  this handcraft stills runs in li ziqi’s family  that’s why she have all basic ingredients and tools using traditional chinese techniques 
это восторг 
she made a whole futon for her grandma and a bed for her dog 🥺 if that isn’t amazing i don’t know what is
that's what we call 100  cotton

this is beautiful
we grow tonnes of cotton, but never once tried something cool  this is the difference between me and this girl   may god bless souls like me to make some wonderful things🙄
she's a legit disney princess, like mulan    but of agriculture
dear ms  liziqi, are you fine? i wish you and your family well  i am very sorry for the people in your country who have suffered from corona virus  i wish triple gems blessed you    
we get to choose one person to represent the human race, i’m choosing liziqi

 11 09 good doggy   some of the subtitles are copied from the subtitles translated by other people which hasn't been reviewed, so thanks to them  liziqi speaks sichuan dialect so i couldn't get everything she said, but this is most of it   i'm still working on my english, so if there are any improper translations please don't mind, and it would be nice if you point it out so i can learn 
i would love to live like this  she's an ancient sprit that came back into the world to teach us the true meaning of life 
maybe she’s the younger version of her grandmother, that is how her grandma raised her🙂
it made me sad seeing her rub her wrist whenever it hurt, she’s such a hardworking person 
everyone's binge watching netflix, and i'm over here like, "liziqi and chill   "
the best thing about her is how she cares and treating her grandmother 👏🏼 the rest isn’t precious as much as that
哈哈，比方說~~棉花的上半+下半生、棉花的一輩子、棉花的兩半生😁😁
big like super good night aap bhi i hamare ghar welcome
有誰也是正在找中文評論的😂 anyone?👇
she’s the princess i want to be like
she is so talented    i really hope the best for her and i hope she won't catch that horrible coronavirus spreading around 
inspirasi banget
english translation of title  "cotton     cotton's life, i promise to think of a new series name next time hahaha"
who wants her to make a house tour or a farm tour?????✋🏻✋🏻✋🏻  i really love the way she live her life away from the city🥰
i barely do anything yet her hands look better than mine  and i am a teenager   
she and i come from the same place  when i was a child, my neighbor was a shop that made new cotton quilts  a quilt can last for many years and is very warm   my entire childhood was spent watching their magic techniques  they have been doing this for many years  until today, new technology has taken away the tradition  few people have made their own cotton into new quilts  the inherited things gradually disappear in the ever changing world  thank you ziqi for the touch   she and her lovely grandma remind me of those plain but precious days 
omgosh  the way she wrapped her dog was so adorable she's truly a pure soul and it reflects on everything she does  hats off,lady   the perfectionist of youtube ❤️
棉花的一生挺好啊…😊 簡單扼要，孝順又貼心的子柒妹妹拍的視頻總能讓我 一看再看意猶未盡，婆婆夜裡睡覺蓋著子柒妹妹用心製作的棉被，心裡一定暖呼呼，快過年了，祝福子柒妹妹與婆婆新年快樂，平安如意～😘😘😘
any indian here i know if any indian is here like me then it is normal we have seen these all kind of work in real life
learned information from weibo of her assistant that she is ok recently, after some days of busy to collect and delive n95 mask and other things to hospitals  running out resource in virus battle zone, now she is trying  to make routing life back to normal from work too late in night editing video in last two years, at same time to  take more time taking care grandma, but still work a lot    ,she may return in these days  thanks 
i'm glad that people in this youtube channel are supporting liziqi during this virus outbreak in china, after reading hundreds of racism comments towards "chinese virus people" on the internet 
from việt nam with love
terus gue apa njirr🤩🤩
it's admirable and while watching, tears started to build up  the part where she fixed it as a bed for her grandma, could no longer hold my tears  and the dog part was like sudden onions thrown my way😢😭❤❤❤
just watching this makes me tired  in a single day she  picked the cotton that she grew herself   which she painstakingly took care of  cotton is not an easy plant to grow  deseeded it herself pulled out and fixed   idk what machine that is, but it looks hard as hell to use proceeded to carefully twine the strings around the sticks of the machine all in like a day    today i got up and was immediately nauseous bc i stoop up too quickly    truly we are undeserving of such amazing content 
you did a great job , very nice
неспешной песней льётся жизнь, пчела летает, зреет рис  здесь всё умеют, могут всё  вот это люди  ё моё 
現在都市人都已經忘了祖先的知識了 子柒不僅讓我們看到了祖先的智慧 也傳承了華人的文化及智慧😀😀😆
don’t worry,she lives country side outbreak in big city she is more safe than people in london
after watching her channel i admire her hardwork, her willingness to do something until finish, her dedication for doing the all those labor  this also made me realize how great the nature is, for giving us everything we need  watching her reminding me say thankful to this wonderful modest life, all this time i have been working hard but not to my heart content but for the sake of papers  wish i can do more of nature labor this year to refresh my mind 
это какое то волшебство    
it really makes you realise how much cotton it takes to make the clothes and bedding we take for granted every day 
李你是純粹我學習汉语翻譯的原因。那麼強像古代英勇一樣的中国女生。我肯定當一個汉语翻譯就是為你，像你這樣的人是我的靈感。從土耳其希望你們平安無事，健康，舒服
everyone one of u who disliked this video are just jealous because she’s smarter and wiser then u will ever be
please add subtitles  🙏🙏
10 58 probably the only best thing i have witnessed on the internet 
to all the people of china my heart and prayers are with you  be safe, be strong and please make it through this illness 
one way to help her is by not skipping the ads, that's how she earns  the longer ad views the more earnings 
i think about how much she can do and make, and remember granny was part of teaching her everything she knows and i just get so happy seeing two strong women out here kicking ass on the regular  💜💜💜
i just cancelled my favourite series movie when i got notification of liziqi new video 😍😍😍
学习了。真是一粥一饭当思来之不易啊。谢谢。
when liziqi uploads i stop everything and watch it 
make a video of what you can't do
i think i am laziest on the earth
i can tell that she's really skilful when cutting the bamboo, cuz my grandpa used to do that  don't understand those who claim she is acting   
she just made a mattress        a mattress    a whole mattress  i'm just useless, i dont even make my bed 
have no words to express my feelings for her  really admire her talent  she can do anything from scratch and does things which brings joy to others hats off to her
the way she was so gentle with the puppy is precious she gave him a new bed without waking him up incredible, she’s like an elf or fairy or something like that with a connection to nature
你好。我是韩国人。  用翻译留言 热情生活的样子很美。 祝你永远幸福。♡♡♡
没有想到 中国的民间文化在youtube发光发热了，加油啊。
كلا شخس بي هد  شوف اتلق ماب  حاط  ليك

dear liziqi, thanks a lot for sharing the simplicity but in the same time the beauty and complexity of the ancient chinese culture  all around your life is so inspirational  living out of what god has created, every single detail on that rich culinary food  as a idea for future episodes,  it would be awesome if you shows us the way you built the utensils in your kitchen, such as bowls, baskets, containers, skimmers, etc  please, please just keto doing what you do, i watch your videos in our living room for hours and it’s just so relaxing  thanks and thousand thanks
love her video  so inspiring   at least i am in peace when i watch her video and forget about the stressful daily routine  
eres muy sorprendente, eres una persona unica, especial y dedicada en cada uno de los trabajos que realizas  gracias por compartir un pedazo de tu mundo y enseñarnos que existen personas sencillas y humildes en este mundo 
i love your videos and feel comfortable when l was it you good girl 🥰
a life style many cultures have lost, to live off what the earth provides  i crave a peaceful life like that, teachings of old ways to cultivate and build with your own hands 
talented woman  really inspiring  i really liked the video  like an angel, she is very calm, beautiful and cool  god bless you, also your fans ❤❤❤
이분 못하는게모여? 대단해여 ~
currently recovering from a sprained ankle and her videos put me as such ease helps forget about the pain too thank you liziqi ❤️

the fact that she made a mattress for her grandma and also her dog but didn't even think of making something for herself       true selflessness ❤️❤️❤️
god this girl is a great
hats off to this lady
這一集太精彩了！ 但我寧願你不要拍，因為看到你彈棉花時就覺得很累，更怕你會勞損！看到最後，子柒太有愛心了！棉被是為了奶奶跟狗狗而做的！感謝你帶給我們那麼好的影片！謝謝！
你是中华文化的传播者，向你致敬！ 过年了，祝你和你奶奶新春快乐，身体康健！
anybody else watching her vids out of sheer escapism  like god what a life ,to own a plot of land and farm and make so many things yourself?? shes really one of the most wonderful content creators
she is just living a simple and great life with mother nature    she is so luckyyyy
i'm chinese    10 29    she said with the little dog “i will make a quilt for you before the chinese new year too,ok?" what a lovely and kind girl 
vous  est  in   expert  an  tout bravo  felicitari
i appreciate the amount of time they took to make each scene   it must have took them hours and days to show us these beautiful scenes     meanwhile all i can do and brag is the amount of time me spending watching youtube or her videos 😂😂😂
mantap abiezz
李小姐，借用您的平台祝福大家身體健康！武漢加油！中國加油！大家攜手共渡難關！💪💪💪❤️❤️❤️
😭😭❤️❤️👴🏥😭
even if she didn’t to everything, so what, she does more than any woman or man i know, it’s entertainment at doesn’t involve hurting someone or shaming someone or laughing at someone in pain, she is showing her culture and techniques that she has learn, what a woman, so humble
the tremendous amount of hardwork she does    is on a whole different level league        and little new members to the family🐶😍
she makes everything possible   theres nothing else that she cant do
are you okay, ziqi? i am really worried about the virus that is raging on the earth, especially your country  hope you and your grandma will be fine  i will always support you  everyone, please send a word of encouragement to her 
this girl’s intelligence n the things she can create are far beyond me
she even made the doggo a bed tvt this lady is straight out of a ghibli film
拍攝幾個镜頭已經四季，取景角度又靚巧妙配合温情。
she's a great human  when i was little i wanted to do stuff like this  make my own furniture, bedding, clothing, etc  i wanted to live in a farm with my own family   it's been 30 years and i still highly admire work like this  unfortunately i wouldn't be able to live in a farm because i have a high fear of insects and mosquitoes  😅
in my grand parents village, this cotton beddings craftmans mostly are men  she must be strong then
when her grandmother came over with that jar of something for her wrist because it was hurt    that was the cutest thing 
看哭了，我也想我奶奶了…希望她和她的婆婆一直这样幸福的生活下去。婆婆一定要身体健康快乐长寿！
living like her could be the key to save earth
even that dog is luckier than me    first time feeling jealous of a dog
the patiences she have is probably what my mom was lecturing about me needing have  😂
in a world having an identity crisis, you, dearest lady, are the definition of how life should be, diligent, hard working, maintaing the old whilst embracing the new, compassionate, strong, exemplary example to the people of earth  beauty, intelligence, humility and fortitude  bravo, bravo and blessings of continued bountifullness  love defined and refined  🙏
for the people who say shes an "actress", i hope you changed your mind bc she is a real 👏 hard 👏 worker 👏
谢谢子柒，给世界各地的朋友带来温暖，祝春节快乐，身体健康
she's so pure she even made a blanket for her dog    
update from her assistant  liziqi is now busy doing spring planting for her farm  her grandma has old people minor sickness as usual so she will also take care of that and also cooking and watch a little tv with grandma before going to bed  liziqi has been having a lot of late nite sleep for pass several years because editing video so she want to take opportunity to rest a bit  her assistant say they knew about us asking for update so perhaps let her rest another half month  screenshot  https //m imgur com/gallery/zmtpvfx
работает не покладая рук  
mind blowing and magical  making the little dog blanket and covering him so tenderly without waking him was pure love  nothing short of perfection  i can't stop watching it 
when we talk of women empowerment  i feel this girl nails it  she is truly in all sense empowered 
protect yourself because there is a high risk of the corona virus in china nowadays  also urge your grandmother and those around you to exercise caution  many prayers for you
me at the beginning  "omfg she's making mud pies  oh   wait   nevermind  "
  
有时心情烦恼的时候看你的视频我心情就慢慢的稳定了 我是中文系的一名韩国人。 中国韩国那些亚洲国家发达很快 这种传统制造方式被机器淘汰慢慢地消失了，很可惜。多么幸运中国有你保存文化而给别的国家人享受文化

i'm not sure i have ever before seen someone with such a tireless and amazing love language as this woman  every video that comes out, i am astounded by her hardworking yet tender nature, and captivated by the process itself  i have learned so much from her, and we don't even speak the same language  i love it

収穫率増やすやりかたやね！
the life of cotton is still my favorite among all her videos  i keep coming back every hour just to watch this
and until the last video you uploaded, the title is still "the life of   " 😂 but it's okay, that makes you remarkable
i feel very peaceful    satisfy when i am  watching your videos your such a incredible  women love you form pakistan
本人就是喜欢100 棉织品 自然透气健康https //youtu be/cfwbjqftykm

great job    she was awesome❤️
ellerine sağlık çok güzel emeğinize sağlık şahane yapıyorsun hataydan selam olsun
ماشاء الله عليك اختي بتوفيق
this video got copyright i think that's why she replace it with different audio
inspirational women🧍‍♀️hands off to u 🙌
not everybody have the patience to wait for a plant to bloom and bare fruit to put it on a video, she is really a mesmerizing person 
ما فيه حدا هون عربي😂😂😂😂😂
so so you're so so pretty girl
when i saw her picking the cotton one by one, it reminded me of a movie called, 12 years a slave, in a cotton field, a whole bunch of people were harvesting cotton in that cotton field, i'm surprised that it took more than one person to harvest all the cotton, while ziqi does it all by herself, she really is a superhero  it just shows that with time and kindness the same thing can be done with amazing results 
awww   she made her granny a warm mattress topper and she made a warm blanket for the little dog  how sweet is that?
if anyone has a desire or wonder why she is the way she is  calm, relaxed, peaceful  i think you should definitely read proverb 31  virtuous wife 
رائعه جدا جدا وفقكم الله
какое приятное видио,смотрела ч удовольствием  
子柒手真巧，好羨慕你，看你的視頻很感動。祝你新年快樂，🐭年行大運，婆婆身體健康。加油喔！👍⋯⋯
one videos takes more than a year to film cause they have to grow and grow the food and stuff so it must take her so long just to make one video for us
beautiful girl 😍
妳真的是太令人感動了，樸實的紀錄著每樣工藝與手藝的自製過程，我是看了大學同學轉貼妳的介紹，才發現這的地方的。 看到留言的文字一大堆都是非中文，就可以了解，妳的創作是突破了語言文字的隔閡，不用講太多，就是實際的做，以包容萬物的心，妳真的是非常棒。

wow  "made in china" takes on a whole new meaning 
 just imagine how expensive could be one of those handmade 
给婆婆铺好了新床垫👍，还轻轻的帮小狗換新被👍让人好感动哦！❤️❤️❤️
when she made the bed for the dog  ngl i cried
棉被，蠶絲，衣服，繡花，筆，紙，墨，搖椅，胭脂，妳還有什麼不會的？ 謝謝妳讓更多人看到中華文化的智慧，中國人為你感到驕傲
she doesn't need money   because she did herself everything what she needs  so proud of miss liziqi
hi from australia, i am 72 years old now and i take  care of my 2 granddaughters,  i grew up in a home like yours ,that is in the  country  a coastal town that is my grandparents  taught me a lot also some of the things you do is what i did after living in the city i found i became ill ,my husband left me with the children so i moved to a country town as i knew how to suvive  i still miss the ocean though  i brought up my children  they have moved to the cities i taught them much ,but i now have my teen age granddaughters with me,  and they want  to learn all i can remember as my hands are not as strong now  you have reminded me much i have  forgotten  thank you,and i do love your  cooking, i always loved cooking in a wok and steeming foods the asian way instead of unhealthy english foods  ,i made rose pettle cordially though ,my grand children loved it  and one said it cured their tummy ach    natural foods  are better for you though it is hard work where i live the climate is harsh  droughts and floods the ground is poor and you cannot grow anything in it so i grow a few things in large tubs    we get by i look forward to seeing more of your vidios you remind me of happy days in my grandparents home  many blessings
people who dislike her videos are so heartless and they dont understand anything 😕
she does everything with perfection  this takes many many years of experience  her grandma must be very proud  not anyone can do what she does   love your videos 
girl  ah, finally, this is the moment   boy  will you ever leave me?  girl  nah   boy  do you love me?  girl  yes, a lot   boy  have you ever cheated on me?  girl  are you crazy?  of course not   boy  do you want to kiss me?  girl  everytime i get the chance   boy  would you ever hit me?  girl  why are you even asking me this?  no   boy  can i trust you?  girl  yes  boy  darling  girl  gasp no    boy  will you marry me?  now read it backwards🖕🖕😂😜  if i made you laugh then  plz support me by subs   ing me  really it doesnt hurt you nor your wealth or data goes but you can help others   makes his life happy  plz🙏🙏😭💊❤
好不容易有中文這麼前面欸 怎麼可以不按贊一下呢 是吧是吧 好啦，真的好愛這個姐姐呀！！！
我上一回看到别人弹棉花，大概也是二十年前的童年时光了
no man is good enough for her, she has surpassed human
小時候我們家的棉被就是請人這樣做出來的，這活可不輕鬆，就算是大男人做這種工作也覺得累，我真的不得不佩服她，確實了不起。
that was an incredible video li it brings back memories of my mother she died in 2014  and how we do that in samoa but our cotton wool trees are tall you have to climb up and cut down or shake the brunches so that those dried bods can fall off the brunches and inside there are small seeds as well another hard work taking them off  it brought memories of how lazy i was cause i was young and lazy lol  now i'm 53   i  dragged my feet    when my mother said that we gonna make some new billows and mattresses  i hated it but dont show too much   ah ah   its a long long process  thanks for bringing back those good old memories with my loving mother and two young sisters thank you li   you look amazing girl in this video   god bless you and your grandma and family 👌✌
子柒好了不起、什麼都難不到你！永遠支持你、努力加油……
me and my daughter have been thinking about you  we hope that you and your grandmother are well  we're also glad that you have all of these survival skills so that it is hopefully easier to stay home until this threat has passed 
she doesn't speak in front of the camera but what she does can reach to our hearts💖  她不在镜头前讲话,但是她所做的事可以触及我们的心💖
太佩服ziqi 的眼力手力！ 还有太有耐心和爱心了。。满满的幸福 谢谢你所呈现出来那么宝贵的 “棉花的一生” 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  也要照顾好自己哦
「棉花的一生」超棒的啊！子柒的視頻真的極具教育意義，適合給在都市長大的孩子們看；謝謝妳分享的一切。💕
4 51 according to her blog, she injured her nose during this video production when she was splitting bamboo to fix the mattress set 
dang, homegirl went into grandma's attic and found the old loom  ? , refurbished it and made her a mattress pad to keep grandma and the doggie warm 
i know i’m not the only one who got teary eyes when liziqi wrapped the puppy in his own wittle blanket  all snuggled in   loved 🥺😭
some info about li ziqi  li ziqi's grandfather was a cook in her village, many of her cooking, woodwork skills etc  were learned from her grandparents  in the initial stage, she did everything alone by herself because she could not affort hiring people  after she became famous she hired an assistant and a videographer to help her 
she's a master and restorer of all sorts of arts   crafts we want to preserve  another stunningly beautiful work  thank you as always 
也就看李子柒视频评论 我才能感觉到这世界的一丝温暖
终于见识到了传说中的弹棉花，太厉害了
imagine to actually live there, just you and ppl that really care for you, away from toxic people  waking up every morning to that incredible view and go to sleep with beautiful night sky    
she melts my heart when she made one for her dog❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤god bless you
下次见面应该是新年了，提前祝子柒新年快乐呀（￣︶￣）↗
she is so quick, efficient and hardworking 
请原谅我liziqi，因为我正在使用google的翻译器，祝您和祖母过年快乐。
most interesting part of this video was when she makes special blanket for puppy, put on him without disturbing his sleep 
умничка 
you are so hard working
the cameraman is a genius too ❤️
口で糸吸って出てきた時綺麗だった。ハッとした。
先父是经營家庭式的織造廠，我自小所接觸的只是棉纱而非原来棉花。所以在这視频增廣了見闻。更要称赞这女孩的善良孝心。非常可贵。
😍genia,cuánta paz me transmite volver a las raíces   felicitaciones 🙋❤️

liziqi's comment on bilibili,translated by google translate  another "lifetime" series  gu yu started shooting before and after    when i was a kid, i often saw cotton growing here but never saw it again when i grew up  at that time, there was a big sunbath near the house  near the dam there is almost 1 acre of cotton  beautiful when blooming   white pink flowers swaying in the wind  i pretend to see flowers in the cotton field,  and pretending to be beautiful ~~~  it seems that at least i haven't changed        i tried to plant it this year worried about variety reasons, i bought several varieties  fortunately, there were buds  i was busy with other delays during the transplant period,resulting in poor final growth   but fortunately, it is a bit rewarding    remove the cotton to dry  and then deseed  when i was a kid, i could find a wood comb for cottonseed   but it's gone now  so i can only rely on my hands  picking one by one is definitely impossible  think of a way  use a wool comb to comb out cottonseeds  it is slower than a carding machine, but also much faster than a hand abstraction   4 pounds of cotton for more than half a day   cottonseed and impurities are removed and ready to be pulled  this is the cotton net  wrap the spun cotton evenly and densely  so i want to pull  pull horizontally and vertically to make a grid,  after the large warp pulls the small thread,  pull left and right horizontally  finally, the longitude and latitude of the large line must be fixed   once the thread is pulled, you can play cotton   the tools are about 20 years old  long time no one used  weathered wood, bamboo strips are almost broken   patch up for a while  when chopping bamboo sticks, i was stuck in the nose by flying bamboo sticks  sanding and polishing with new beef tendon strings can also be used   remove cotton seed cotton and loosen it with a stick   cotton is too dead to bounce off easily  more and more tight   playing cotton is really hard work   this is not an exaggeration, it is more laborious than letting me carry dozens of catties   when i was a kid, i surrounded my uncle every day to watch him play cotton  haven't done it in person,  this time i was doing batting for my grandma  i learned it two days in advance   too strenuous  10 pounds of wood,  and the force of the mallet pulling the tendon string  on the basis of this force, we must maintain balance and loosen the cotton   both hands must work hard to maintain harmony  if you can find this old object, you can feel it 
你好，很高兴认识你。我是日本人。  我碰巧找到一个视频。不错！  为你加油！注意不要感冒！   因为中文不好，所以不能很好地传达心情。 对不起 
彈棉被，這麼原始而古樸的器具與作法，真令我開了眼界，厲害了，子柒 
most people have forgotten how to do these things because of manufacturing and capitalism, where jobs are broken down into smaller and smaller components  nobody remembers how to make everything you need for life anymore 
she also deserves the highest subscribers among the u tubers  why don't we all give out our best thumbs up and also subscribes her channel by sharing with brothers and sisters if she is willing to shear her knowledge with you and me 
我小時后看過用鋼絲彈棉花，李子柒彈棉花用牛筋繩，那是更古老的技藝，讓人佩服！
when all the hardworking people from ancient civilizations reincarnates into one body
每一次影片都很好看，這一集更是精彩！ 人美、風景美、畫面美、感情也很美，原來棉被是這樣做出來的，喜歡你給小狗狗做的棉被，要繼續加油，期待你的影片更新：）
protect this person at all cost  she is an inspiration  my bad for discovering her channel at this time only  but binge watching won't hurt anyway 
with the world in this way i think living like her would be perfect and an example to follow
i died when she made that blanket for the dog  someone do the same for me
這紀錄片就是文化傳承，農耕藝術，生活藝術，傳統工藝，是思想文化的洗禮，是芊芊玉手，層層風霜，沉甸甸，李榮榮，喜滋滋，苦巴巴的勤勞，結實實，樂哈哈的豐收        是大道的人生，是偉大的讚歌。巾幗不讓鬚眉，現實版的花木蘭，穆桂英。贊！
这集把我看哭了。这么能干又温暖的小姐姐！天冷多穿点！干活戴手套！🥰
this girl is really too special for this world    an all in one type of human being   
i like this beautiful girl so much, it's not only because she could do everything which we think that it's impossible to be finish by a person even a woman, but also i could feel the beauty of eastern civilization from her, every scean and each lanslide in video remind me of how chinese culture is attractive  the most important thing is that many of us have lost us into the fast and new thing from western culture instead of pursing chinese traditional culture and spiritful thing  this video is deserved to recommend to our millennials who have obessed with so much thing from other country like japan cartoon and anime, korean k pop  let's hope that there are increasing this sort of traditional  promoted chinese culture video
綿花の栽培から綿布団を作るところまでを見れるなんて思わなかったよ。最高の動画をありがとう。
she is such a hard working woman     hats off  and who the hell are those 13k people     who disliked the video
很难相信这么美这么沁人心灵的作品，却是先在海外火起来才带动国内的（没有其他意思），看着身边许多人沉迷那些土味视频，还把网红、流量明星等浮夸垃圾当作“美”，只觉得李子柒实在是一个很特别、很有审美的人； 实在不知如何形容这样的美，留句词吧： 流水落花春去也， 天上人间
谢谢女神… 辛苦了… 原来棉被是这样打出来的… 谢谢你的爱…🥰🥰🥰 对待老人还有小动物…😘  过年了 也愿： 好学的美女子柒：          新年快乐！          健康平安幸福美丽！ ☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️ 🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎
you are a beautiful hard womam
9 7k dislikes??? why? i don't understand why people's dislike video's like this such of inspiration also the music is so relaxing can someone who's dislikes this video explain to me why you disliked the video if you have ball replay my comment
i admire this lady on a spiritual level  the sheer resilience, diligence and willpower exudes overwhelms me  i love how wholesome and pure her affection towards her grandmother is  to a certain point i’m kind of jealous but that jealousy is what makes me strive to be a better person  i wish i could communicate to my grandmother the same way she does and i wish i could be as hardworking as her  the more videos i watch of this lifestyle the more i start to change those “i wish” to “i will”, watching how peaceful life seems there fills me with a sense of determination    but i’m still procrastinating doing science revision
i wanted to thank your great country, china, for helping italy to overcome this drastic period  thank you 
it brings tears to my eyes how she takes care of her granny  the people that dislike this must be either very misinformed or just made of stone 
man, i swear, this is how you live a fulfilling life  i know its not for everyone but if i was given land with a house i'd never work a 9 to 5 job again 
i would risk the corona virus for her  😌    p s  "if your offended by the mention of corona and don't have it, sit down and eat some soup"
the smile on her grandma face when she sat on the bed was priceless  such a precious granddaughter
oh to be liziqi's dog sleeping peacefully wrapped up in one of her home made blankets
salute for the patience and effort  each thing has a story 
my heart melts when she made her granny and her adorable dog a beautiful blankets   👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻god bless you💚
the world  people are destroying me with chemicals and technology  me  no, liziqi will save you with her hands  😊
i wish you, your family, and the rest of the people in your area safe from the outbreak  stay safe    wuhan jiayou, zhongguo jiayou     greetings from a javanese chinese indonesian here 
quem dá deslike em um vídeo desses???
she out here making a bed i’m out here not even doing my bed
chinese executives  "what do you need for your show?"  liziqi  "just more puppies "
弹棉花呀弹棉花，半斤棉弹成了八两八哟，  旧棉花弹成了新棉花，  弹成了棉被那个姑娘要出嫁。  哎哟勒哟勒，  哎哟勒哟勒，  弹成了棉被那个姑娘要出嫁，  那个姑娘要出嫁！！
哇，好厉害呀！上次做的是丝棉被，这次做的是棉被。上次让我看到了蚕丝是怎样拉成丝的，这次让我看到了小时候看到过的弹棉花，还知道了可以这样用蜂蜡。👍👍👍

the amount of hardwork in this is more than my entire life

я в шоке, это прекрасно💗
i always watch your videos while in classes where i am able to  when we have free work time  and while doing homework and you calm me down so much it’s amazing ❤️
her hands sore from making the bed meanwhile my hand sore for using phone for too long

after watching her impressive skills ,even i became her fan
her making and giving the little puppy a blanket was the most wholesome thing i've ever seen  ❤
the fact we all like watching her work hard while we’re in american laying in bed eating hot cheetos 
人美心美的仙女👍🏻看到也幫狗狗做了毯子好感動啊😭
i was wondering if she is ok because we haven’t heard from her for a while? hope she and her grandma are ok ?
哈哈，弹棉花这个手艺也算是中国的非物质文化遗产吧，子柒真的太牛逼了，谁能娶到她真的算上辈子烧香了
is there no one going to talk about his brother love who is always with her and never came on camera   i read about her on google and get this information when she completed her study and started working for a company    she left job and came back to her village    never seen such dedication it's amazing to see her videos 😊😊
我的年紀，我在小時候也看過，家里也種了幾年，我也摘過棉花，，看子柒做過，很有同理心，我所知道應該只剩一家店，很老的夫妻在打棉被，那種棉被我家還保存一件，我一直没去拆封，存在我的記憶空間里，祝福李奶奶和李子柒，平安，健康，快樂美好，2o2o年→→ >→→
一針一線，一思一念，芳絲子伴，數夢華年。  祝安康
making comforter for her grandmother is ♥ warming  she can afford to buy a new one, but this shows love conquers all  lucky puppy got one too 
在这里能看见李子柒小姐姐的身影，作为一个中国人真的很骄傲。你的生活态度和方式渲染了每一个国家的人，真的为你骄傲
me ur big friend i am bangladasi🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
i want a friend and life coach or instructor like her  i'm willing to learn manual labor for a year  blessings to you li  may your work and labor be prosperous 🙏🏼
子柒身上有着国人勤劳、宁静、坚忍、不争的气质。为你而自豪。
弹棉花呀，弹棉花，把半斤弹成八两八，懂得人点赞
she is cute 🥰
the instrument she’s using is also used in most arabic countries in the past   the guy who make the cotton quilts is called kattan from the word cotton
10 50  oooo what’s she making with the leftovers? a pillow? knee blanket?   gives dog new blanket with the gentlest of tucks   me, crying profusely  o oh
and there’s me who just got their plant from school and has died
وينكم يا عرب
when she sucked that string through a branch i was officially done
手作業って大変だね。やっぱり凄い技術者だ
李子柒的很多视频做的让我想起了小时候在村里，弹棉花也是邻居就有一家··还去学过，很难！
i don't know chinese  hope you understand my comment here  " you are a very special person who helps inspire more motivation to other people in vietnam, included me  by your videos from the beginning until now, i understand that mother nature is huge and unlimited and being offering too much for the human  we should live close to our natural environment instead of trying to change it in our ways " love you from vietnam  ❤️🌻🌿🌾🌼🌸💐
this woman has better cinematography skills than 99  of hollywood
李子柒所有视频里的事情全部都是亲力亲为，很多为了拍一个视频花费将近大半年时间，说假的良心不会痛吗？ 有种事儿逼总是这么矫情，自己懒癌啥都不会又看不得别人那么厉害
最後のわんこ用にほっこり   ´ ▽ `   
she made abed for the dog im so soft rn 😭😭
 she could replace "perfect" word with her name on dictionary 
i felt my hands hurt as she was picking the cotton, i felt so bad for her 
the love she put into what she made for her grandmother and little dog is absolutely beautiful   ❤️
原来棉絮是这么做的啊！？长见识了！！！
子柒的片子越做越真實但又不失唯美，喜歡💕
her granny must be so proud of her as she’s carrying her legacy exact the way her granny used to be ❤️
someone  i bet you can’t make     lizi  hold my beer
種棉花， 拿出家傳之寶的工具， 我們廣東人叫打棉胎😂👏真的多才多藝💐
advance "happy chinese new year" to you, to grandma and to your crew  may you be blessed more, pretty princess  👸🙏🎉
this woman is clearly an empath  that's why she's so loved and loving 
she is wonderful,she is nice and know everything about nature
that dog at the end is soo cute 😍
that dog's name is guogai, her oven is made of her  that dog shaped oven 
shes the most astonishing woman ever  give her the credit she deserves 
her grandma looks so proud  that sweet smile was my everything 
❤️ это самое прекрасное видео за весь период просмотра ютуба для меня     на сегодня точно  
such an amazing lady   hope i can live with you   to experience that kind q of environment and how to be with your grandma    keep safe always  
بسم الله ما شاء الله انا مش مصدق كل هذه المهارات والقدرات والابداع حقيقى انتى نعمه لكل من حولك وهم محظوظون جدا بوجودك وعن نفسى اود ان اشكرك شكر كبير
one of the most inspirational amazing videos i’ve watched in a long time and the 2 lady’s are so beautiful xx
when the grandma passes i bet she will hand craft the coffin and have a beautiful ceremony
only if i can see my grandma smile just one more time like her grandman does
your videos are eye catching  wow 
what a beautiful life, i cry
้เหมือนจะเปลี่ยนเสียงเพลงหรือเปล่า ที่จริงจะได้ยินเสียงตอนที่เริ่มทำผ้าน๊าา 😂😂
such a beautiful video  so i want to be there with this girl 
it is my pleasure to see my translation  ‏😍فلم خيالي عائلي ورعب👽 تدور قصته حول فتاة مدللة، لاتملك صداقات لكن تعلق قلبها بدمية شبيه بها            ونتركككم مع البقية ‏⁦‪https //youtu be/cuzuxswlunw https //youtu be/ve9pkr0uzzi،
oh gosh i just watched her videos today and im so addicted to it that since morning i've been watching all her videos and didnt realize that its evening now   this girl is so hardworking and talented  god bless you dear ❤❤❤❤
i want to build house like this type of location  this location look like very beautiful and make my mind peacefully 
looking at those gourds always reminds me of cultivation manhwas lol
i want to live a life like this sooo nature friendly, and soo freshh  ❤💫
真是太能幹了，每樣手藝都夠一個普通農民一生為職業了
has the music changed? i think there were different sounds in the second part of this video  like usually   some background music, but you could hear what is going on there too  now it is just piano   i have seen this video like 3 times and i think it was different before 
does your hand have power  when you planted everything why they are growing surely well🤔🤔🤔
and my friends wonder why i obsess over old material hand woven  i used to have a business selling antique and vintage textiles  now i am retired and must part with some of my collection  i just see how painstaking doing it before machinery was and a labour of love went into it  even the fancy monograms for the family initials could be beautifully done  i would love for this  lady to have a farm style bed and breakfast, a working holiday to learn her craft  but i am sure is very busy with her life as it is        she lives a beautiful life
what lady    she knows everything,ably to do anything  
hi li ziqi  it'sbok to name your series with 'the life of   ', at least we know what the video will be about  keep safe, to both you and grandma  ♥️
이자칠 언니 보는 한국인은 나 뿐인가?
boys saying girls are weak  me  how about now
looks so comfy   
she loves her grandma and her dog a lot, i admire her
ماشاء الله   😍
when she picked up the little dog and gave it to her grandparent it gave so many memories i remember when i lived in filipeans and has a family of dogs living at my place, the house was close to the beach and u had to climb down a small cliff to get to the beach but the life there was peaceful everytime i went on vacation with my family some dogs weren't there due to death and there was always new dogs  i still remember a dog named koi was there most of the dogs bite but koi seems kinda old and peaceful so she would never bite but she had very low health i hope the next time i visit filipeans koi is there
i'm at the scene, i'm the tool in li ziqi's hands, come and envy me
i love her lifestyle 😍
очень интересное видео  👍
she makes her own food for her and her grandmother that’s just sweet she puts hard work in to her food
wooow such an talented youtuber
亞柒姐太勵害什麽都懂！誰娶了她就太幸福了。制作影片實在又朴素且清雅脱俗！👍👍👍
fenomenal girls 
she’s zero waste in everything she does, everything has its purpose  😍
人生这是第一次知道了棉花如何从种植到做成棉花被的过程，谢谢农耕文化传播。
8 30 look at how defined her hands are  they aren't dainty or delicate looking  they are rough and well sculptured from hard work  i can't imagine all the calluses she has from doing this 
in the us i was raised in the south where we grow cotton   and i know how hard work it is   this was a lovely video   thank you
10 44 she wounded her nose while splitting the bamboos, according to her weibo 
棉花為什麼要彈 彈棉花的目的是為了使得棉花變得更加鬆軟暖和。     彈時，用木槌擊大木弓的弦，等把又舊又硬的棉絮彈得鬆軟後，再用紗線縱橫布成網狀，以固定棉絮；最後，再用木製磨盤壓磨，使棉被平貼、牢固。
这个视频从春天拍摄到了秋天，单是想到如此用心都会让人感动不已。
なんやこの古風で野性的なのに美しく気品のある感じわ、、、 俺らが想像する伝統的な美しさが詰まってるチャンネルですね👏
this woman is wonderful  in addition to being very talented, she is extremely strong and dedicated 
想起一首老歌，“有一天我经过一家古老的棉被店，那里面传出一种声音，听起来多亲切，李老先生对着竹杆弹着弦，叮啷当啊叮啷当，弹着他的弦      ”
it's pretty cool to watch people do things the way the old world did it  for most of the modern societies this is a forgotten skill 
i wonder where is liqizi now and how is things going with her? don't you guys? i've been visiting her channel 8 times this week hoping to see her new video  i hope she is doing well 💚can't wait to see her new beautiful works😍
her grandmother is so lucky to have her  she really love her
i hope she's okay and where she lives is not infected with coronavirus 2019   ncov  
ziqi  showing how cotton duvet is made from the cotton seeds manually   me  moved to tear  amazing 
and here i am being lazy and complaining about my problems  she’s a true inspiration
the most beautiful, talented woman i’ve ever seen  she can make anything out of everything  
биз дагы пахта остурот элек ссср мезгилинде  жаратылышы  абдан кооз жер экен бул кайсыл олко  кыз да сулуу, назик ,мээнеткеч айым экен,  баштаган ишин дайыма ийгиликтуу болсун сулуу бийкеч 
very difficult technique and requires a lot of patient and hard working but the result is beautiful  great thing to do for grandma  love her passion and devotion not mention her look , she is a beautiful young lady, inside and outside
童年回憶，在香港沒可能再見到的手藝！ 一個人操作整個過程，實在太疲累，太能人！
who needs a boy child?  this girl literally single handedly holds that place down  i'm not sure if it's a politically correct  thing to say, but that's what came to my mind   so excuse me, if i offended anyone 
//uses leftover cotton to make the puppy a blanket//   everybody liked that 
お布団♪一から作るって凄い✨💦 ワンちゃんの赤ちゃんもいっぱい♪ 暖かそうなお布団でぐっすりネンネやね♪  ´ω｀  
着实感动 李子柒的一路轨迹 很值得赞许   于朴实无华处 顺天感灵
i’m convinced she has more than 24 hours in her day
when does she sleep? ? she does so much i cant
fantastic brilliant
i live with anxiety and panic disorders  i can't describe how relaxing this girl's videos are to me  she is amazing 
批評她冇讀多少書 冇學歷的人能做到嗎？。 她是聰明的”冇學歷並非因 冇資質讀。 有的專業拍攝的”韶為冇可能一人拍得這麼佳水準”她一人能辦到 有一視頻因她而出了自拍視頻教學。
please be safe in ncov or any illness people of china my prayers is with you my chinese brothers and sisters  prayerforchina 🇨🇳  jiayou     from a filipino fan 🇵🇭
10 58，世界上最幸福的狗，我酸了。
i really don't understand how she can make anything she does look so beautiful  her videos truly bring out the hidden beauty of nature  aesthetic appeal is so much vivid in her videos that i can watch them over and over again  even when i don't understand anything 😂   let's keep supporting her  
humans sometimes forget how rich we are just with nature's gift 
that dog sleeps in a better matress than me😭
i love all her videos that are winter themed 🥰 it’s like she ensures she uses her talents to warm others 😭🙌🏼 i love her grandma so much too~~i wish we could send them post cards so they know where all their fans come from 🥺💗
thank you for caring for her and i can tell you she’s fine right now  because of the virus we have to stay at home and she can’t update her video right now because she’s donating some masks and some money for wuhan and we are so honored to have such a celebrity in china  so she’s fine right now  and you guys don’t need to worry about her 
4 52 did anyone notice there’s a tiny spot on her nose after she did the woodwork? that’s actually a tiny wound  according to her assistant’s post on weibo, a scrap of bamboo stroke her nose when she was chopping  luckily it didn’t hit her eye    better wear goggles next time 😂
你用的工具都是有历史性的工具，太有意思了～
the last few moments with the granny and the pup is just oh my god
so who is happy , when every time she uploads
我靠, 原来弹棉花, 真的就是在弹棉花    
this girl who lives in a province has better cam quality than pewdiepie

it almost feels like she's living in heaven  everything is there  while in city, we are working like slaves and having a shitty polluted life

인생에서 한번쯤 자연에서 나는 식재료를 직접 채취해서 요리해먹는 평화로운 일상을 느껴보고 싶다고 생각하게 만드는 영상이네요
спасибо большое, очень круто и вкусно
내가 찾아보는 여러 유튜버 통틀어 가장 깊은 시골에서 사는 것 같으면서도 가장 손이 많이가는 요리들을 하고 사는데 가장 선명한 색감의 영상을 뽑아내고 있음   
이건 진짜 한번 먹어보고 싶어요😲😲😲  대왕 가마솥부럽네요🤗🤗🤗🤗👍👍👍🔥🔥
왠지 의천도룡기 주인공이 되고싶다
it actually kind of does look like the perfect pork
food always looks amazing and delicious
요리왕비룡을 보다 결국 여기까지왔군
字幕あるのありがたい  ˘꒳˘   
еле досмотрел     жена откачивала  слюной подавился    
우와~ 역시 요리의 세계는 넓고 크고   기름으로 저장하는 고기라  처음 봤습니다  👍
it's funny how these chinese dishes seem like they are full of fat, yet they are still healthier than what most of we americans eat 
i miss these kind meat   when i was child  my grandma used to make it   😭
free tibet free hongkong
이분의 요리는 티비에 나오는것보다 더 정성스럽고 건강에좋을꺼같은 느낌  돈주고라도 가서 한번쯤 먹어보고싶은 영상들
oh thank god they translated what the cat was saying, otherwise i would've had no idea 
the way she prepare the dishes its absolutely awesome  specialy its clean😋😋😋😋 congrats
this was my mum’s favourite as a kid growing up in romania   without the chinese spices

i appreciate that the subtitles translated the asian cats "meow" to english
thank you so much dianxi, seeing you make this food and learning more about chinese culture/cuisine is amazing  i once told my dad that i would learn how to cook chinese food, i know, i'm a bit crazy but the internet is connecting us all around people like you  i don't look for the negative things, i look for the beautiful things that people do and what you share is wonderful  keep going  i know i will make this dish one day and it'll be because you taught us how  谢谢
after seeing her videos i have decided to change my idea of our new kitchen insted of an modern island kitchen we are going to build a traditional indian kitchen, there is no point in being with the mainstream it may look good but doesn't feel good, i need a kitchen like this to remember my roots all my great great grannys and their recipies   thank you so much 
the background music and the whole ambience of where she is working makes it very soothing to look at

튀겨서 부패를 방지하고  기름으로 저장시켜서 또다시 상하는걸 방지하고 또 다소 퍽퍽해질 수 있는 고기에 지방이 스며들게 하는   꽤 과학적인 레시피다

there is an observation i'd like to express  the greatest assest in life i think i, obviously money  the greatest liability in life is also money  the later is true as when we get money we don't know what should we do  well  food  travel  get educated  all simultaneously  that's what money should be used for only  because all the three ends are rewarding  more rewarding that humans in general  
the music, endless  pork fat drenched  the triangle hat, pounding vegetables, perfection
중국음식은 죄다 기름이네요  그래서 차를 마시나?

これ、絶対旨い。 しかも、映像が綺麗！
日本語字幕！！！！！ありがとう！謝謝！
feel so impressed when i see the food from my hometown in youtube 
建议同步下英文字幕，这样可以吸引更多流量。
omg this made my mouth water from start to end
راح ازوع 🤮🤮🤮😳
something about this all feels so pure and nostalgic, even though it's so radically different from my own life  i'm envious of the ability to go on a walk through the countryside for fresh vegetables, cooking for a whole family and seeming so content and at peace  love your videos, and thank you for this look into another way of life 
so calming and soothing  i want to achieve this level of emotional comfort 
this is absolutely incredible  age old skills many of us in the western world have lost making us vulnerable and unable to store food in traditional ways
소리도 영상도 너무 아름답다 ㅠㅠ
nice way of preserving food,thank you for sharing this 
she made the god damn grease can i get  a moment of silence 
예쁘다 헤헤
لحم الخنزير محرم بالاسلام الحمدالله على دين سيدنا محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم

that meat scares me

казахстан 2020 палец вверх
parabéns pelo vídeo  interessante  descobrir que culturas tão distantes compartilham os mesmas técnicas  aqui no brasil  minas gerais  a arte de conservar a carne suína na gordura é chamada de "carne na lata" 
did somebody time travel to the past and shoot this video? it's weird seeing such rural lifestyle and cooking with such amazing videography   
video perfecto para ver a la madrugada cuando el cielo gira
in mexico we call that carnitas=}`
love it❤❤❤
ничего не понимаю, но так нравится эти видео 💞💞💕💕😍👍👍🤗
i really like your food you make
xứ trung khí hậu mùa đông lạnh rơi tuyết, ướp thịt không bị hư  ở việt nam để ba ngày chắc chỉ sẽ bị hỏng☺
1 22 did this music sound like a legend of zelda breath of the wild song?
hey you looks so fresh eventhough you work in hot kitchen     you should do a video revealing your beauty secrets      i really like your videos        i have become a huge fan of yours        please respond         
you're so beautiful   ❤️❤️ and a perfectionist too >
beautiful 👌
shes literally the ideal wife of any man
この人の動画の視聴回数には何時もながら驚かされます。 ヒカキンよりも上かも。

i never a knew a pork belly video could be so peaceful and soothing
the food that you share is very delicious and interesting  thank you for everything
such harmony from first second to last      i don't think i'll ever experience that sense of farm to table bliss 
she must be some cousins or relatives to liziqi or at least neighbors
the cat just throw my focus off xd
такая воспитанная собака 
i love you work, i'm from el salvador,  excellent
日本語つけてくれてありがたいです！
looks great, the culture and style of cooking i'm a big fan of 
so she uses vpn? how did she defeat the great firewall of china?
お肉とても美味しそうです！
for some reason, her twisting that cabbage out of the ground felt more violent than all the meat chop she was doing 
can i come over  i'd never go home after eating  i'd chain myself to the front door
super duper  
whatever she cook, it looks good, delicious, effortless   clean 
이분 영상 쭉 보고 있는데     진짜 행복해보이신다    너무 행복하게 살고 계신다는 것이 눈에 딱 보여요   
with great cooking like these, asian kids will have no trouble eating their veggies  eating disorders must be rare in china, africa, latin america, the middle east and the rest of asia where good home cooking still prevails 
i'm still thinking about how to describe your art
마음이 평안해진다 ㄷㄷ 근데 먼가 드라마보는거같음
油封肉/油底肉   真有趣
i’m so glad this has english subtitles  also i love the music, classical is my favorite
what a wholesome looking way to live
as if i'm watching an emotional cooking movie    the sound, and the editing, the character, the pasion
every single video calms the mind in a serious beautiful way
ни слова не понимаю, но мне нравится, что она готовит  очень красиво снятое видео и то как она справляется
日本語対応！！❤️ ありがとうございます😊✨
the way of living you show us is so precious  not even gordon ramsay could complain  
the simple beauty of this woman working in harmony with everything around her touches my soul
영상 진짜 잘찍으신듯  잘보고 있습니다~

3 13 에서 저만 박력넘치다고ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 멋있다고 생각했나요? 진짜 음식하시는거 보면 대단하다고 감탄 밖에 안나와요   
this was the most beautiful thing i have ever seen   can i come live at the farm? please, i am respectful and strong, so i can work  i'll make my own home on the outskirts of village, i will not be a problem   please, please 
伝統なんでしょうけど、良く陶器の瓶が出てきてそれに料理入れてますね。日本では見かけませんね。美味しそう！
your family is so lucky to have you   all your cooking looks delicious   wish i could smell and taste it   thanks for sharing your fabulous cooking abilities 
ufff pero mira esos chicharroncitos papaaaá  solo faltó un poquito de limon y un par de birras
中華鍋一つでなんでも出来る🥕
she looks cute and lovely  just adorable
저거 먹으면~~ 혈관이 막혀 죽는다, 지방많은 삼겹살 굽고나면 나중에 불판에 기름이 굳어서 허연 빠다처럼 된다, 그게 혈관에 들어갓다고 생각해봐라,ㅋㅋㅋ
my cat understood what the chinese cat was sayin   😁
your recipe is the best recipe in the world my mom also like your recipe
i’m from indonesia    i'm so inspired astonished and amazed to see the chinese people in the countryside are cool♥️
everything she owns is huge
那个油底肉炒蒜苗。。。我太想吃了。
can you see sempak? the sempak is very very beautiful odete😍
wow    that cat must speak fluent chinese better than me   
어우 막혀가는 혈관과 침샘      꿀꺽

그냥 요리하는영상 조회수가 2천만ㄷㄷㄷ

i do not know your language, yet i love to see you and everything you make is wonderful

すごい美人だ！

she is living my dream   
here in the philippines we call it "tinabal sa sebu" tasty and yummy , nanam 
요리하는데 브금왜이리 구슬프지ㅠ

this was absolutely fascinating to watch  love the cooking process 
여기가 대체 어디지 다른 세상인듯
beautiful lady amazing land lovely food  mmmm this food very simple, it lets the ingredients speak for themselves   her knife skill is good  presence is warm and lively  what a beautiful place
снято красиво  особенно природа  но у меня вопрос как я сюда попал   
that's real quick and legit fresh veggies from the farm  i hope those ingredients are all written in english  hello new subs here, from the philippines 
from indonesia
in my land we would call that carnitas estilo asian , looks really good   
se fosse no brasil, diria tem lugar à mesa?
a gorgeous woman, fantastic food, absolutely beautiful place what more could a man ask for     i would marry her and live there in an instant, even though i wouldn’t understand the language i wouldn’t care i would learn the language 
when i was 11 my uncle solano butchered a pig, and set it on a spit that was part of there kitchen, my aunt made hot mexican chocolate with cinommon stick slowly in a clay pot hung at a smaller spit hook  it was christmas , the odor of pig roasting over slowly and the chocolate, as it thickened   made me feel like i was special  best meal ever    
dianxi and liziki are my two favorite youtube channels
중국 가정식 요리는 처음보는데 한식처럼 야채나 볶음이나 찜이 많네요  음식도 맛있어 보이고 마을도 정겨워 보이고 좋아요ㅎㅎ
woohoo, this made me really hungry  my stomach grumble as i realized i don't have any food in the fridge  time to go grocery shopping   
wow, chinese foods are sure tasty and nice decorated  would love to try chinese cuisine   
damn that pork was cooked to death, brought back to life, and cooked again 
such cooking skills with a great deal of pride, reminds me of the women in my country, we cook the same   love to see the way these women cook without a fuss but a choice to eat what they have   bless her   👍😋❤ 🇹🇹
i saw this and i say "oh i wanna try this, it must be delicious "
no entiendo nada pero eres genial    xd  saludos desde venezuela       
when she cut that pork at the end my stomach started growling hard lol
как же уютно😍😍😍 успеха вам💞💞💞
if you were a bed and breakfast, how lovely life could be 
feels like im watching k drama and i know it'll break and satisfy my heart
sounds like the room soundtrack
美味しそう。なんで低評価するんだろう？
日本語入れてくれてるの嬉しいー！ ありがとう😌✨
요리할 때 뭔가 호쾌하다  대파 탕탕 치고 써는 소리라든가, 고기 털 태운다고 슥슥 크게크게 비비는거나 너무 좋아   ★
muy riquísimo, su comida es perfecta 🤗😋😘,saludos cordiales desde monterrey nl méxico 
i will find you someday and i will marry you 💍 💕 💭
hello  i am from azerbaijan and she is very beautiful girl😇i am sorry,how old are you? this channel is perfect♡

i don’t understand, what she say but this cooking style wow
요리 영상인데 마음의 평온이 오고있음    
she is lucky for having this life   and i'm lucky for discovering this channel 😎😎
please see
that cat only appears once every blue moon 🌚
your living an awesome life  keep it up  you can get everything fresh, having high quality food 
i, too, have a 60" wok at home
watching videos like these reminds me that happiness is found in simplicity too  for many, it's the most fulfilling kind of happiness  taking care of a land, enjoying the fruits of your labour, being in tune with nature, sharing moments with your family  the fewer things you need to be happy, the happier you find yourself to be 
i like how whatever you need you take from the field and go
it has been a long time since everyone in the family sat around the table and had a dinner  i miss that time 
pork greaves = cracklin aka gratton, aka some yum yums  in louisiana
hi, dianxi xiaoge  do you know your video is popular in korea? i'm so glad other korean people become to know you  d and other korean youtubers also made this watching this video  > thank you to make good videos always   
i wish i could eat her cook, looks yummy 😋
how are you, my friend?
kitty  what is the cat's name?
hello  i enjoyed the video a lot and i have a question   how long does the lard sealed pork stay good?

영화의 한장면 같다
i love how when she’s done cooking she takes it to an elder to eat 
meow meow
б лиать, ютуб удивляет  откуда это в рекомедациях?     я прост в шоке, но лайк поставил,  круто ведь снято   я бы на такой женился 
that old guy at the end of the video will live another 100 years if he keeps eating food like this
a very interesting video  with the addition of a very beautiful young lady  and a great meal to finish 
você está de parabéns isso é que é uma mestre de cozinha 🥘🥢
that looks delicious but probably tastes absolutely amazing 😁
かまどの火でこんなにも上手に料理が出来るのが凄い！！
healthy chinese food        no joke  can we call it traditional chinese keto?
i've done it   i betrayed liziqi by watching this  what have i done??
레알 너무 평화롭지않음? 요즘 최애 채널인듯  살짝 촌스러운 브금이 오히려 진정성을 더하는 느낌임 
感謝你弘揚中國飲食文化，飲食文化很能反映民族習性。
와 기름에 담궈서 보관이라니    신기하다  
日本語の字幕ありがとうございます✨ より、楽しく見れます  ´ω｀    毎回、動画楽しみにしてます🤗
nothing can best chinese cooking style    my opinion of course <3 
интересное видео, отличная подача материала, подписался, лайк, посмотрю ещё ваши видео 
que lindo  gostaria de saber o nome dos temperos usados por favor 
i watched this video for the second time today and wanna try badly the pork she cooked 4 25  it look wonderful  why don't you open a restaurant dianxi? she has a lifestyle which is so inspiring in this busy world 
i do love the your village  i wish i own a farm in your village  it looks beautiful and peaceful
all that effort and working in the kitchen, as of me   cooking a simple dish takes about 1hour  she made it look so easy to prepare 
뭐지 이 어마어마한 요리와 영상은   
linda arte de cozinhar  meus parabéns daqui do brasil 
im a skinny guy i feel like if i stay in her house for one month i'll get healthy 👋
peccato che i tuoi video non siano in italiano  comunque sono bellissimi  brava, un saluto dall' italia 🏳️‍🌈🇮🇹😘😘😘😘😘
one of the most beautiful videos here on youtube ❤️😍
이거  방송국급  연출인데      이상하다      진짜  시골인지    걍  연출인지     
despite the place and the beautiful music and the lovely dog and the cute cat i found this video disgusting  
i love how they eat together in the end it makes my heart melt~
que delícia  parabéns 
素晴らしい‼️凄く完成度の高い料理です。流石世界一の料理‼️凄く参考になりました。有難う😆💕✨
apart from cooking one another thing i really admire is the "family fond" as an indian we are proud of having joint families ,three or more generations living together,respect for elders,love for each other thats the cultural identity common in both civilisation  chinese and indian the woman is sweet and adorable and her cooking skills are of high standards 
my cardiologist just fired me for watching this 
هل هذا للحم خنزير
liziqi and dianxi😍 both great vloggers and from china wishing philippines is just like china simple and peace
日本語字幕全部に付けてください！！！とってもありがたい！！
her meowing back at a cat was hilarious
just watched ur videos from the greeny island srilanka❤ love your videos much❤ i'm also doing cooking videos but in the forest in srilankan traditioanl style and with the rhythm of the nature 
why in the hell i'm watching this smh
do you remember the taste of refining lard to make oil based meat when you were young? oil bottom meat, we call it "braised meat" locally  a long time ago, the ancestors invented this method of storing pork in order to prevent the pork from rotting and spoiling, and later it became a particularly delicious dish 
wow thanks for the techniques of preserving food we love chinese foods ,we also cook it in the philippines as our traditional foods especially noodles  
they say, heaven is a place on earth    probably, this is it   
it ’s amazing  i want to try it 
fresh all ingredients and no artificial flavor ❤️❤️❤️
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷parabéns 👏👏👏 você é uma excelente cozinheira 😄🤗
wish can cook with this calm situation 🤣🤣🤣🤣
有大王ㄟ。還有那隻小花貍貓ㄟ😍真好。這就是農村生活。讚👍
来自摩洛哥的法蒂玛，我希望我们可以就烹饪和交流经验进行交流
노래가 너무 좋아요 ㅜㅜ 브금 좀 알려주세용

요리왕비룡님 영상보다가 들어왔소
걍 아무 이유 없이 이거 보러옴 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 알고리즘 아니고 내발로 찾아왔는데 볼 때마다 안정되네
thank you quarantine for bringing me to youtube and showing me this video
i really love to watch her everyday i love the lifetyle great job  hello guys i am new youtuber here wish to hug someone new here too  
i feel taking a one little short yummy journey  so comfortable feeling all the time  it would be great inspiring subject to me to draw cook life with touching stories  少し短いおいしい旅をしているような気がします。 いつもとても気持ちいいです。 感動的な物語で料理人の生活を描くことは、私にとって素晴らしい刺激的な主題になるでしょう。
i really loved that dog 😍
支持滇西小哥
you seem so down to earth, unpretentious, and your personality is so cute  i also enjoy seeing you with your gorgeous, massive dog  it's clear that you love each other and that you take good care of him  i think for these reasons your channel is my favorite one of this type  although i do enjoy the others too but it is a different mood   i'm chinese american  my dad speaks your dialect  unfortunately, i only speak cantonese so i hope someone can translate 
the music reminds me of something i don't want to remember 
중국 운남성에 한 토착민의 놀라운 유저육 조리 영상이었네요  한국어 자막이 있어 더 좋았습니다  잘 보고 갑니다  谢谢 老师！
im wondering how you clean that large pan or pot something
a ver si tenemos un poquito mas de respecto a la vida de los animales,que tienes a los  cerdós y otros encerrados en una mierda de un metro por un metro, y otras cosas que me voy a callar,en fin  ascó puro

i love the way she prepared everything  the end was so lovely serving her family outside  looks like paradise  keep up the great cooking 
i watch this and i feel like i'm betraying liziqi who started this kind of videos 
my grandparents would preserve pork liks this in romania since they didn't have a fridge , it was the best thing ever   people in the countryside still do it to this day and in winter you can find it in some of the shops
the music in this video is of great value as a lullaby 
손이 참 야무지시네요~  
고것 참 맛깔나게 요리 하시네
愛呀這個姑娘是打哪來是住哪個啊 真有才啊
vs grandpa kitchen two asian superpowers war about cooking 🇨🇳vs🇮🇳 i cheer for both of all  two countries are both famous for gourmet 
滇西小哥，很喜欢你的油兔芭频道，加油！

중국에선 인육 요리 하는게 맞나요?
honestly, i am impressed with their cuisine, for those of us who are not from their culture, particularly i am very impressed and it is very interesting, their sauces, vegetables, meats in their different flavors, i think they are fresh, smoked or in the form of bacon , if i'm not mistaken  i had the great opportunity to get to know oriental food in my country, peru, of course not as intense as you do  i must congratulate on your videos, it is inspirational, i wish you good luck, miss or mrs dianxi 
انا من السعوديه وقد أعجبت بترتيب واتقان العمل في المطبخ  بتوفيق والنجاح

돼지고기로 요리하는 음식 중 제일 손과 정성이 많이 가는 음식같네요  맛이 정말 궁금하고 언젠가 먹어볼 기회가 있으면 먹고싶습니다  집에선 도저히 시도해볼 엄두가 안나요 ㅠㅠ

아름답다  그냥좋다  
언니 요리 보는거 재밌는데 비지엠이 넘 슬퍼서 눈물나ㅠㅠ
anyone else got this on their recommended videos?  however, the way she cooks reminded me so much of how characters in samurai x aka rorounin kenshin cook  so much peace 
after watching liziqi chanel and supposely to go sleep but made mistake by click this  however its such a best mistake ever 😍
i want the "control over mind dawaang has standing beside these meats "  
那個肉看起來超棒

one of the best videos i have ever watched  thank you  i am a new subbie 
these are the best carnitas dishes i’ve ever watched 🤤🤤🤤 🇲🇽 🤷🏻‍♀️
imagine having that big of a pan and just cooking hotdog cocktails in it
how big do you want your knife? dianxi  yes

that pork frying made some vegan faint lol
cada vez estoy más convencido de que en otra vida fuí chino, adoro esta comida, y a esta hermosa chica también
아 저 야채볶음 너무 먹고싶다 흑흑ㅠㅠㅠ
기름고기 크 ㅋㅋㅋ 여자친구 외할머니가 한다라이 해서 저장해두던건데    我爱吃女友外婆做的 一点都没有油的感觉，干干净净的肉味。 如果有机会我可以参加你的youtube吗？ 我打算冬天去云南
 it's the best     i came to play because my father liked it 🐾🐾🐾 the quality of the picture is really beautiful here 
in hungary we do the same thing with the pork   the name is   szalonna  😘😳😳😝
hello    indonesia mana nih? bukan krn apa yg dimasak tapi vidio yg disajikan, natural, alami, alat yg digunakan traditional sangat jarang dijumpai dijaman serba modern skr😍 selalu sukaaaaa liatin vidionya😂😃
in lebanon 🇱🇧 we call it "awarma" but we're not using pork, just lamb or beef
i'm my thirty years of existence i never knew that theres a hairy tofu 
que hermoso todo lo q haces es todo artesanal sabes así hacemos las cosas también en méxico saludos desde guanajuato méxico
как называется эта банка с водой в горлышке? хочу такую же
i love hairy tofu a lot  i miss it and i don't know where i could find and buy in thailand 
looks like the best cotton candy ever  yum  i'm going to look in my local grocery stores 
i like the way you film your video but ican't eat this things
i came here like “hairy tofu  hell no” but after watching i admit i really want to try your cooking  looks incredible 
the comment section looks so updated that i taught it was a new video lol
if that tofu is alive ,id love to have one as a pet   it's so cute 😍
i’m so high i thought they were little baby chickens 😂
i love you videos
give some of that tofu fur to my bald sphynx kitty🥴
i don't even know what tofu is, nevermind a hairy variant 
y’all are scared of mold but still eat mushrooms?
it's amazing, if i had a chance to eat this, i wanna try to eat  there is so many effort for making this tofu  
it was recommended but it was worth it  but wait is hairy food does it?? chinese people  yes we make everything
well, that moldy tofu looks delicious  i gotta try some 
in fact, this is a superb food processing method  soy protein is decomposed by mold to obtain more flavorful amino acids, which is more conducive to human digestion and absorption 
i only eat that hairy tofu if she cook it fir me 
кто нибудь понял что это? мне показалось, что тофу в плесени, но это не точно 
estoy encantada con las recetas mostradas,  pero me gustaría    que se traduzca los ingredientes utilizados  felicito toda la forma y herramientas artesanales para cocinar 👍
факт  вы не искали это видео🗿
i'm chinese and i didn't even know hairy tofu is a thing
i thought they were hamsters in the thumbnail
nobody notices the great camera work and editing? kudos to the people behind these amazing videos
just imagine getting a piece of fur or hair stuck in that, then eating it  🤢 it’s too fuzzy for me 😂
sla, só sei que o youtube me recomendou kkkkk  satisfatório assistir eles fazerem isso
i felt for a moment that hairy tofu looked censored
if my tofu looks like this, i would never eat that o_o  but i like this kinde of videos😂
immediate reaction   thats mold
you are really an inspirational person you remind me of my home sures when i was back home  good bless you and bless your work 
when i see tofu i always remember kim dahyun
what i thought i was making when i mixed all the shampoos in the shower
idk if i'm being weird or something but those hairy tofu look so cute
this is a form of tofu i have never seen before, so interesting 
外国人が納豆を気持ち悪がる気持ちがわかった気がする
man, and i thought i was sufficient with my protein intake dayum  i want that 
where i am from, when i start to see the hairy stuff on food or anything i throw them away  so do everyone else 
i have this weird urge to keep one of those tofus as a pet   
i'd like to know what the season g she used at the end of the video was, looks like those tofu pieces were fermented in that big jar 
it kinda reminds me of cotten candy though i'm sure it doesn't taste like it xd  i am curious about what is happening 🤔  is it a mold or something? or just how tofo reacts over time  i have no idea  🤗 though it's probably on my list of things to try at one point  😁
relaxing moment in my life
띵동 한국인을 발견하셨습니다
love you so much keep work, fans for indonesia🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨
i somehow managed to read the title as “there are several ways of eating  h a i r” after seeing the thumbnail💀 cuz i never knew this thing existed
i thought she was holding and feeding bunnies lol
most of you said i can't eat this   although it is their tradition but what about cheese?  it is also a  bacteria  that takes a long time   but the  tofu  was left overnight and the fire was on🤷‍♀️
두부도 털이나는데 시팔 내머리카락은  
the first time i came to know about this tofu is from a hong kong movie  i wondered how it taste ever since 
can't stop watching this even after a year the tofu looks so cute and fluffy and i am drooling it must tastes good
i love how you always make tofu from scratch  💗
damn i never know it exist but it looks so good  it was so properly done in a very clean environment  i love the way you film your video too✨✨
they should’ve named it cotton tofu it sounds more appetizing than hairy tofu
no one   literally no one  me   i don't even know what tofu is  ? but it looks tasty 😍💝 ps  omg       i got 15 likes ✨ thank you all for these likes     i'm very happy 😁☺️💖
the ending is so good     i want that pot   😄😄
still dont know what happen to the tofu cube, like when this "hairy" thing came from???
lots of love ❤️❤️❤️ stay safe take care stay healthy all family
i thought those were baby chickens at first 😂🤣
いやっ…毛って笑 ただのカビやん 絶対食べたくない笑笑
 me just looking at the thumbnail not minding the content's title  wait— are those chicks?    me reading the vlog's title  oh, a tofu  wait— a hairy one?  
그러니까 하얀곰팡이가 생긴 두부인데      그냥   먹는가보네       
i thought it was hamster in the first place before entering 
우연히 보게되어서 지금 정주행중인데 와    정말 플라스틱이 하나도 안보이네요   영상은 힐링 그 자체입니다
so relaxing 🥺❤️
watching from dhaka, bangladesh 🇧🇩  love❤ for chinese🇨🇳 brother   sister from bangladesh🇧🇩 
there is truely an art to all of this and alot of hard work    well done 👍
i just love your presentation  thank you 
everything looks easy on youtube but in reality  this life style is extremely hard   if you have to think about the processes   i hope you know that it took a few days and lots of work 
我是云南人，看小哥的臭豆腐又想家了，点豆花的场景好熟悉啊，满满的家乡味，游子小时候的记忆。
何これ！？めっちゃ美味しそう！ 食べてみたい！！
не очень понятно, но очень интересно   
i want to know who first looked at mouldy tofu and went “i’m gonna eat this”
こんなに丁寧に作られているなんて正直驚きました。大切に食べようと思います。
are you sure that it was edible  it looked like it had fungus on it's surface 😐😐😐😐😐
유튜브 알고리즘은 정말 진심으로 이해를 못하겠어        한국인 없냐
i didn't knew she get millions of views  such a hard working and gorgeous woman deserves viewership and praise 
many people making comments on hairy tofu   it’s their cultural food   we should not comment on it    cheese is also bacterial activity equivalent to fungus   but we love eating it   
i feel like theres just a small community of these fairies that live somewhere in the mountains, self sufficient, and multitalented with the most aesthetic shots and perfect editing, making things you’ve only dreamt you had the motivation, talent, and patience to do 
several ways of eating what
лохматый тофу называется,обычно такой заводится в холодильнике у поваров похуистов
so amazing place to live   fresh air and a great family i really want to live in a village like you because in the big city i cant see mountain or big tree all i can see is dust and smoke   say hi for your family love from bali ❤️❤️❤️❤️
a lot of effort to make tofu  yet we buy it so cheap 
제목이 한글이여서 들어왔는데 한글댓글은 별로 안보이네
estou amando o canal dela  realmente é de uma simplicidade e além disso te acalma, sem falar que ela cozinhando é lindo  agrada os olhos da gente ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i watched and was struck by how privileged i am  i just drive to a grocery store and buy food as needed  refrigeration and freezing food  very sobering watching the long process from harvesting to table  that’s true labor 
sis makes me want to live on the mountains and build a farm
i get hairy bread when i've left it in the cupboard and forgot about it   
youtube algorithm someway got me into this now i want to eat tofu
이 영상이 왜 추천에 떴는지는 모르겠지만 아무튼 유튜브 추천은 훌륭하다  영상 퀄리티보고 바로 구독하게되네  그리고 수많은 유튜브 채널이 있지만 이 채널에는 뭔가 고유한 느낌이 있는데 그게 좋네 
그니까   흰곰팡이 인건가?
wha    i thought it was bunnies in the thumbnail   
 wax it before   eating men   already know that  
i’m a filipino working here in heilongjiang, china  i’ve never seen this here but it’s worth trying  there is a lot of chinese food that doesn't look good but tastes awesome  💯
이거ㅠ보니까 그 생각난다 새벽 여섯 시에 일어나 콩밭에 가서 콩 털어 할머니 밥 차려드려 그리고 해떨어지면 자빠져 자 또 새벽 여섯 시에 일어나 콩 밭 가서 콩 털어 또 두부 처만들어
i though on the thumbnail were baby chickens  i am confiusion
沒有他們（她們）我們哪裡來的食物 知福惜福 飲水思源 懂得感恩 我們看不到他們的辛苦 自然而然 就會浪費食物 一但體會過或是看過 就不會在浪費食物了
over here that hairy tofu wouldve been consider “expired” 😂😂😂
when tofu hits puberty
your video is good but not as much liziqi    its just an amazing i like to watch liziqi more
중국판 리틀포레스트 느낌 물씬 난다    조용하고 한가롭고 따뜻한 단편영화를 한 편 보고 난 기분 
tofu has hairs   😨 meanwhile my bald head  shine bright like the diamonds in the sky 😄
just gonna assume that the "hair" is a type of mold?
who else thought they were baby chickens in the thumbnail 
i’m kinda grateful that i don’t have to put this much effort into making food because if i did, my lazy ass would be starving 
サムネがハムスターにしか見えない…
i really want to taste this hairy tofu and am totally disgusted at the same time   
美食，美景，饞人
the beauty of it is that she made everything from scratch  from farm to food on the tabl  an art in itself
第一次看到毛豆腐。想不到這影片這麼多國際朋友觀賞
i feel transported to a different world when i watch these videos
두부집효녀
이 영상은 주기적으로 와서 두부 튀기는거 까지 봐야함
when it said “hairy tofu” my biomed degree immediately screamed
เห็นเเล้วอยากกินจังเลย
한국어로 번역되어 정말 좋었어요 한국 번역 버젼이 별로 없어 아쉽지만  번역되지 않는것들도 나름 열심히 보고 있어요 도전하신 것 정말 잘하셨어요

黄豆不吃了 做成豆浆，豆浆不喝可以做成豆腐脑，豆腐脑不吃了可以做成嫩豆腐，嫩豆腐不吃了可以做成老豆腐，老豆腐不吃了可以做成豆腐干。实在不行做成臭豆腐
진짜 힐링 그 자체    근데 갑자기 이게 왜 떴는지 알수 없음   
i clicked on this cause i thought they were kittens 
so the hair is mold, right? or could it be something else?
this is so much better than watching two dudes build a pool in the middle of the woods
people in the comment is talking about how they wouldn’t eat a mouldy tofu, but it’s the same thing like cheese or beer  it all goes through the process of fermentation  i think this tofu is delicious and everyone should try it  it’s really creamy 
the bigger question here is what does it even taste like ? i'm so curious
there's other chinese girl named liziqi who did the same thing   her cooking skills was amazing 
 for some reason i thought she was eating a hamster 
one of the ways is to not eat it at all 🥴
no one       literally no one  philippine vendors  tahooooooooooooooo  
to be honest if your saying hairy tofu is disgusting then i would like to say it’s on the same level of cheese and beer 
カビ生えとるだけやないかい
발효시키면서 나오는 곰팡이같은데   곰팡이맞죠?  청국장도 , 메주도 그런씩으로 발효시키니 유익균이다 볼수있겠어요 
지금 당신은 한국인을 찾았습니다
두부에 털난거 귀엽다 ㅋㅋㅋ큐ㅠㅠㅠ 짚단같은데서 숙성하는거 보니까 일종의 곰팡이  ? 균으로 만드는건가
i've never seen like this before 😁
if i ever get a white fluffy dog i’m naming it tofu

i've never been so confused in my life
알고리즘 뭐냐
i really admire chinese cuisine     the food is obviously delicious but what's admiring is the process of cooking  meticulous and skillful
곰팡이 두부라니 ㅋㅋ 근데 귀엽다 왠지 폭신할거같애
acaba tadı nasıl güzel bir yemek gibi 😋
китайский дор блюинь?    сыр тофу с плесенью?

i like traditional food
뭐야? 완전 신기해    털이라길래    그냥 조금 있겠지 했는데, 완전 솜털 같다   우와  😲
soay beans milk processed so fungus will grow massively  so then they can eat them in the winter   that's brilliant  and u people still eat mashroms? dah
또 보러옴
youtube a year later  “here you go”
i remember my grandma and grandpa, seeing how you made the food, and the way you smoothen the soybeans using that tool  steering stone  really like my grandma's  at their hometown, long time ago, i remember them, but now is gone, as like they are gone to heaven, thank you to reminds me and keeping me more and more in love with them and forgive them
정감가면서도 스피디하면서도 이국적이면서도 리틀포레스트같으면서도 신기하면서도 좋은영상이네요
people nowadays don't realise how important it is to eat fermented food like stinky tofu or the furry fungal tofu here  or even kimchi or sauerkraut  they're amazing for your digestion
i thought it was a bunch of headless chicks😑
i am sitting , in my house watching all your videos eating a bag of walkers crisps beef n onion flavour lol dear me i wonder what shall i cook f tea  lol wish  i was in your house what great food  you cook  best wishes from england uk 😋

비룡님 눈돌아가겄다
이렇게 보니 도리깨, 키, 맷돌 같은 농기구들이 우리나라랑 거의 유사하네  같은 아시아권이라 비슷한듯
when i'm making video or start doing editing or whatsoever i love to open your video in background hear the sound of the things moving,its still sound peaceful but lot of things going   
wait she's not liziqui? wow, that's why the stuff are so different, there's no wood involved 
who the hell was the first person to makr this and how did they discover it  dude left tofu out too long and it turned hairy  proceeds to eat it 
나 썸넬 무슨병아리 키우는줄 알았어   
công thức làm đậu nành, đậu phụ giống của việt nam quá    
hairy tofu  snow doufu  tastes like cream cheese  after the first bite, i fell in love with it instantly  great to see the way you make it  genius chef 
tbh i came here thinking this was liziqi's channel
neden buradayım nasıl geldim
모두부 안휘성 황산의 특산품인데 직접 만드시다니 대단하십니다 모두부 구워먹으면 꼭 치즈같은게 엄청 맛있습니다 황산 여행가시는분들 꼭 드셔보시길
❤️🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰❤️ weldon, nice  👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
this channel is super informative
ты очень красивая девушка, лучше всяких фотомоделей
много видео где народ пробует еду готовую    и я даже боюсь представить как она была сделана    но вот это    и правда хочется попробовать   
that fried hairy tofu looked delicious though 
😭 it loses its fluffiness going through the further recipes    i thought the hair was firm by looking at the thumbnail photo lmao  btw i agree with calling that ‘fluffy tofu’, not ‘hair tofu’  but i think it’s because the idea asian people have about the word “hair”  毛  is not that disgusting    i mean, if i showed my mom the name and the actual hair tofu, she would rather think it’s hilarious ‘cos the tofu has denser hair than my dad 😂 and she wouldn’t feel that disgusted thinking of animal hair that has dandruff or dirts on it  
amag yan sis😂😂😂😂
굳이 두부를 털까지 나게해서 먹는거야?̊̈?̊̈ 석고까지 넣어서?̊̈?̊̈   원래는 간수 넣지않나    역시 중국 식성특이해
yes that is fungus 
lol when it showed the tofu being ready, i thought i was losing wifi connection 
am i the only one who thinks the girl is stunningly beautiful ?
filthy frank  ez
you are so hard working person
석고 주성분   황산칼슘 한의학에서도 사용할 만큼 오래동안 사용된 광물  옛날부터 두부에 사용, 우리나라 한국 은 염화마그네슘 간수 을 이용함
it will ne great if its subtitles are in english for general understanding, because it looks really good but don't have any idea what's going on 
신기하다 역시 전통음식들은 어느 나라든 발효가 빠지질 않네
alguien que hablé español, que me explique por favor 🙏🙏😅veo esto, y en verdad se me hace muy interesante 
bu ne kadar zahmetli yemek  
technically  its tofu with fungi grown on top of it
우리 두부는 간수를 넣는데 이쪽은 석고응고제 자막에따르면 를 넣는구나   콩가는건 우리랑 비슷하기도 하고ㅋㅋㅋㅋ진짜 싱기+힐링
곰팡이핀거아닌가  ??????
i just came here after watching how italians make mozzarella 
세상에 신기해요    식감이 어떨지 궁금하네요🤔🤗 영상도 너무 이쁘고 한국어 자막덕분에 편하게 봤습니다❤❤
i love how different asian kitchens are compared to american kitchens, seeing the cultural differences in the way they make their food and how different their food is to ours is so interesting
neler yaptı fasulyemi onlar
이 영상 너무 힐링된다    모털두부    첨들어봤는데 만드는 과정까지 다 봐버렸네   ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
can someone tell me how it taste, like the hair part cause i wanna 👄
i̇s it halal??
1 45 두부에 석고넣는거 처음보고 문화충격 먹어서 검색하고 알아보느라 1시간 날아갔다     결론= 식용석고를 쓴다지만 석고두부 많이 먹으면 신장결석 생김 https //www wikitree co kr/articles/221904
i have never seen such good cooking skills and moreover everything was homemade and handmade  no cooking machinery was used  not even a domestic burner  hats off   regards from india 🇮🇳
omg she is so beautiful ❤️
你好，姐姐 i come from vietnam 💖🇻🇳💖
すごい。 このお豆腐作り、手間暇かかってますね。
it was nice when she put the tofu to bed 😌
me seeing this on my recommeded  there's hairy tofu???
갑자기 추천영상에 떴길래 봤는데 뭔가 영상미가 좋다    잔잔한 이 느낌 넘 좋아♥
이 분 영상보면 현실 스타듀밸리 같음  진짜 시골요리의 먼치킨 같아 
this is amazing, you're just like liziqi 🙂
와   이분 영상 진짜 힐링이에요 공부나 취업 스트레스 쌓이신 분들이 보면 좋을것 같아요
뽀송뽀송하고 솜사탕같을것같은데 저 뽀송이의 정체를 알것같아서 먹어볼 용기는 안난다       😭 영상미좋아요
my cousins reaction to seeing a harry tofu    thats fkin moldy
is it fungus which is grown on those cubes🤔
i like your cooking very much  😍
磨成豆漿以為可以喝了，結果還要做成豆腐。 做成豆腐以為可以吃了，結果還要發酵。 豆腐長毛以為可以吃了，結果還要曝曬。 真是急死我了。
my adventurous side says " oh yeah "   my normal american side say " are you just cooking moldy tofu ?" either way i would eat it if you invited me for dinner  now i'm curious 
hairy tofu is very taste  someone might want to know why it is hairy  it is because of the bacteria  but this is a benificial bacterial, which transfers the tofu to be more tasty to make fermented tofu, it has a similar process  normally, tofu has a very plain taste  but after this transformation, it tastes really good 
seeing how passionate the girl is making the hairy tofu is very wholesome
i discovered hairy tofu at 14    jokes on yall
i wanna try this actually i'm a fan of tofu but it's first time i've watch hairy tofu i wanna know the taste
tofu değil bacım küf o jdjdj
hairy tofu is definitely a tofu with fungus on top 👀
갑자기 왜 뜬건진 알수 없지만 힐링 그 자체다     산속에서 산뜻한 공기를 마시며 누워있는 느낌    
새상은 넓고 희한한 음식은 많다
菌類と一緒に料理を完成させるのいいな、人間以外の色々な生命の手を借りながら自然の中で生きていく……かっこいい 慣れてないとお腹壊しちゃいそうだけど

i was watching a video about jaclyn hill lipsticks then this showed up lmaooo  hairy 
anyone from grandpa's kitchen 😂? these channels are all about rural cooking but the former one is an indian grandpa
the way she respects and takes care of her elders is a beautiful thing🥺💗
영상 색감도 너무 이쁘고 보는 내내 조용하고 집중되게 만드네ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 무슨 영화 한편 보는 것 같다    
sao giống bị lên mốc v mn ?? lên mốc meo lm sao ăn dc ?
i love watching your videos , they're so calming and i love your way of living
オススメ動画として表示されて見ましたが、毛豆腐は初めて聞きました。 毛豆腐は、豆腐を発酵させて、フカフカな毛を生えさせたものです。 一瞬、｢身体に良くないカビでは？｣と恐ろしく思いました。 しかし、納豆やキムチを初めとした発酵食品は世界中に多数あり、毛豆腐もその一種です。 機会があったら、食したいと思います。
🤭
곰팡이있는 치즈도 먹으니 저두부도 먹을 수 있긴할텐데 머리로알아도 선뜻 손이 안갈 것 같다 무슨맛일까 엄청난 별미인가
멀쩡했던 두부에서 털이자라네    무슨일이있던거지 
so does this mean it’s kinda like molded   ya know when things mold they get kinda fuzzy
am i the only who never knew   that hairy tofu is also there???? 🙂
superb 🥰😍
me watching  “how to build an iron golem farm”  youtube  would you like to see someone  hairy tofu  ?   the answer is yes, yes i wanna see hairy tofu
진짜 신기하다 어떻게 저렇게 뽀송뽀송하게 되지?? 만져보고 싶당    귀여워  
amazing   beans prepared so beautifully    love those jars 
eww  mouldy 
she is so beautiful ❤️
두부 엄청 좋아하는데 생으로 먹을때 식감이 되게 궁금하네요
i thought they blurred out the tofus😂
هل هنا عرب غيري ؟
i am wondering if hairy tofu has a specific odor to it or it's odorless i've tried homemade  fermented bean paste, which had a tangy taste and a strong odor
콩물에서 간수넣어서 단백질을 분리하는게 아니라 그냥 응고제로 콩물자체를 굳혀버리는거구나   신기하네
곰팡이 같은게 아니고 곰팡이 맞지 않나요
sorry,  but hairy tofu is something i’m going to pretend doesn’t exist 
藁を使ってるみたいなので納豆菌とかの菌糸なんだろうな
? 저거 곰팡이 아니야?? 먹어도 되는 균이겠지만 저걸 처음 먹기 시작한 사람은 무슨 생각으로 먹은걸까   가끔 이런 음식보면 너무 신기함 외형적으로 먹으면 ㅈ 되지 않을까 하는 음식들 각국에 많은데 그걸 처음 먹어본 사람이 존재했으니깐 만들어 먹는거잖아  
congratulations on becoming popular            in china❤🇨🇳 i really likes your videos and recipe           🍱🍲🍜🍤🍙🍚yum 😚
xế hà nội xin chào 500 anh em    
저게 곰팡이인겅가요
뭔가 되게    볼수록 기분이 좋아진다    <> 
두부에 핀 곰팡이를 먹는다는건가? 그나저나 곰팡이가 터키구름사탕처럼 생겨서 뭔가폭신하고 맛있어보인다~ㅋㅋ식빵처럼 생기기도하고~ㅎㅎ
love from india  when viewed your videos then,  i feel very fresh       thanks happy christmas
毛豆腐可愛すぎて兎かと思ったwww 世界にはこんなのがあるのか！ 熟成？されておいしいのかな？ 食べてみたい

3 33 집을때 새소리때메 병아리같당ㅎㅎ
はじめて知ったけれど、凄く美味しそう…素敵な文化だね
que es eso? y porqué youtube me lo recomienda? 🤪
this was recommended to me after watching a banana time lapse of its rotting process  same fuzzy white stuff 
이건 따왕이 안나왔네  언니가 따왕한테 머라하는게 킬포인트인데

что это?
damn that aint hairy thats mold
everything was so cool to watch   i'm not trying to be negative in any way, i am just genuinely curious if the hair is actually mold  if it is mold, then is it safe to actually be eating  is it like a non toxic type of mold? ohhhhh did you expose it to sunlight to kill the bacteria 
кошмар какой  плесень кушают 🤮
nature is paradise 
надеюсь никто не отравился😲

我想問 毛豆腐是      發霉的豆腐嗎？
毛豆腐かわいいな……
第一次见到毛豆腐，对于素食者的我真的好想尝试，看着好好吃～
olum tofu lan bu
you are very hard working
日本で言う納豆とかの感じなのかな？ 不思議な食べ物もあるんだなぁ。
no wonder why you have so much subscribers, this video is quiet calm and relaxing to watch  i also love how you use you're own creativity 
why hairy tofu? fuzzy tofu or fluffy tofu would sound so much more appetizing    or at least appealing
interesting 🤔 never heard of hairy tofu  thanks for sharing👍

진짜 인생 채널    한국인에 대해 어떻게 생각하는 지는 모르겠지만 이 영상보고서 적어도 중국 저 지방은 좋은 곳이란 걸 알았고 이 채널 진짜   내가 아끼는 채널이다ㅜㅜ
日本のみなさんで分かる方いる？ わらを使っているから納豆菌みたいなもんかな？ 自然で平和そう、この方達、コロナウイルス大丈夫かなぁ〜
she’s so pretty and so gentle and so in tune with the process, i hope she’s doing great and healthy <3

發霉的豆腐？

なんかウサギみたいで可愛い毛豆腐😍
인생을 이렇게 살아야 하는데   
그래 알고리즘아 날 여기에 부른 이유가 뭐니?
맛잇는 손두부 만들어놓고 왜 일부러 곰팡이를 피워 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 그정도로 맛있나? 마음으론 식문화가 다르니   하면서도 머리론 이해가 안됌 ㅠㅠ
her making this video a tutorial  me  funny you think i have the facilities for this big man
to anyone may not know this hairy tofu is the equivalent blue cheese
just imagine that one guy who first tried this food  "oh, a  hairy tofu  i should definitely try it "
it's so interesting to see other peoples cultures
이렇게 요리 잘하는 사촌언니나 이모 계시면 좋겠다 ㅠㅜ   티비 유튭으로 볼때마다 감탄했었는데  폰으로 보니까 자막도 뜨네
beautiful process but i'll pass, i wouldn't eat these things   😵
이런 감성 너무 좋다   두부 짱신기   
썸넬 보고 병아린줄,,,
이 채널 뭐였지  생각만 하고 지나쳤는데 갑자기 뜬다  미친 소름돋ටㅏ,,난 그냥 생각만하고 마음속으로만 말했는데 알고리즘 미쳤네  
撮影の仕方も好きだし、一つのものをじっくり時間をかけて作り上げるのってなんだか素敵です。それに料理は美味しそうだし…！即フォローしました‪w
진짜   클라스   절대 못해먹게 생긴 요리들 너무 많아요     
раз такой долги процесс,новернека очень вкусно
모 털 두부 튀긴 거 스팸같다 
okie first of all, what makes the tofu hairy? is it mold? is it bacteria growing?  wich is literally mold so 
как все чисто 
알고리즘 다시 쿨타임 돌았나보네
i thought that was furr
много труда, простой быт     эстетика этого видео лишает дара речи 
臭いと食感が気になる… 納豆みたいな発酵ですよねー
yakk_thats_rotten_tofu 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
вкусняшка 😂 привет всем ✋✋✋
this confirms my theory that you can make _anything_ edible by deep frying it    beautifully filmed and edited 
엥   갑자기 두부가 털이되어버리네 신기하다
大家的留言都是英文～ 我來留個中文～
you are so naturally beautiful and humble   ❤️
all of this time i could have had multiple opportunities to make hairy toast at home but instead always threw the bag of bread away    🤦🏽‍♂️
毛が生えるまでは美味しそうだった 小動物に見える笑
 i thought it was "how a cotton candy is made in traditional way" 
this is why asian people live more than 100 years 
she is a hardworking lovley young girl  bless her
戦後くらいの動画観てる気分になった めっちゃすこ
こんなモフった豆腐があるなんて知らなかった どんな味なんだろうか、想像つかない
こんなお豆腐があるんだ。すごく手間がかかってそうだけど、その分とっても美味しそう。
wow   at first, i thought they were cute little chicks  i just learnt something new  hairy tofu 
isn’t the hairy stuff mold?
تعجبيني بزاف تفكرني بجنقوام 🎎جزائرية مرات من هنا🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿
이제는 알람 뜨면 제일먼저 본 뒤 자막 뜨면 또 보고 하는게 일상이 되었는데, 사실상 제일 먼저 유입한게 이 털두부라서 ㅋㅋㅋ 감회가 새롭네요   
always wait for the next vid 
respact   you
not gonna lie, that was some hard core asmr👌🏽beautiful
this is the magnificent mold work, just like the westerners with their many types of cheeses  either way, i'm not sure i have the stomach to eat it    
nobody  the lunch my mom packed me 3 years ago  
見たことないたべものだ、、、豆腐ぽい？？ 作ってる時の音がめっちゃいい😍
idk why pple r thinking it’s gross, like y’all eat moldy blue cheese 🤮🤮
外国人が納豆を知ったときもこんな気持ちなのかな…。
오 신기하네 취두부인가??
i ain’t never going to make this in my life, yet i watched the whole thing lol
i feel like whoever first came up with hairy tofu must have been low key trying to poison someone lmfao 
サムネ見た時 一瞬ヒヨコ掴んでるのかと思った‪w
i am half chinese from thailand  your clips are so amazing and warm touch  i love them all , please keep upload the wonderful menu      
すっごく綺麗な動画。。 何回も見てます！！！
she totally reminds me of liziqi  
я обалдела от того что эта девушка умеет готовить  такого ещё ни разу не видела, думала меня уже нечем удивить        столько всего вкусного, так и хочется к ним за этот столик присесть  удивительная девушка, да ещё и красивая  👍🥗🥘🍲🍜🍚💖💕
サムネ　　「ひよこ」 動画内　　「なんだこれ…」
wow that tofu definitely have a pubic hair noice,,

ai que saudade da amélia, aquilo sim é que era mulher    😭😭😭😭😭
😍😍 chuí rs brasil 🇧🇼🇪🇪🇧🇼
so    tofu is not much more than soy beans soaked and boiled?
i thought the tofu just got molds  
as a chinese, we incorporate these “hairy tofu” into our dishes all the time, it’s just that when it gets processed, the hairiness is gone
이렇게 귀여운 곰팡이는 또 처음보네   팡이팡이
真的開眼界了 好厲害的 ~真想吃看看 ~
毛毛的好可愛     還會做毛豆腐www
毛豆腐好可愛喔 😍 我超愛吃豆腐的
me looking at the thumbnail before actually reading the title  "oh shes raising hamsters now?  how cute"  after watching the vid  "wait those aint hamtaros  they r foods"
大開眼界👏👏
어후야~~~구독자가 611만      돈을쓸어담네 아주

………サムネの綿みたいなのがヒヨコに見えてしまった…………美味そうだけどその綿みたいなやつの原理が気になる………
i have only heard of stinky tofu so this is a first for me  i feel somewhat scared of the idea of something wt a giant hairy mold on it but it's not too disimilar to eating other fermented food like tempe or blue cheese 
hello my friend 🙏welcome hoba and mama🙏
i like pickle tofu  i think it's the same one  the last one she did fermented in the jar 
seeing the thumbnail i thought the fluffy white things were white chicks 🐥
milhares de comentários inglês eu procurando português kkkk , pra ler

我发现大陆的youtube粉丝都是世界各地的啊！！！现在留言中文都被国外的给占领了
우와 이런 음식이 있다는걸 처음 알게되었어요  뭔가  솜사탕같기도 하고 퐁신퐁신해보여요😄 한국어자막이 있어서 덕분에 편하게 봤습니당♡
3 36 넘 보송보송해보인다      뽀 송      
헉 첨보고 먹어보고싶어요  영상이 너무 예뻐요 ㅠ ㅠ
두부에 석고를 넣는거보고 놀램
whenever seeing films like this, it’s just amazing how they made such a cooking process in the past   it was so nice mood with a comfy bgm and good camera compositions
when i saw thumbnail, i thought that was chicks and i was like how the hell they eat chick's hair?????? 😂😂
여러분 저 털 곰팡이에요
영상 이쁘다
뽀송뽀송한채로 옴뇸뇸 먹으면 솜사탕처럼 사르르 녹을 것 같오  
the fur shaped tofu is so cute   
すごい調理法ですね。チーズや納豆のようにワザとカビさせてあのような糸を纏わせているんですかね。 栄養価の高そうな豆腐の完成ですね。
이분 정말 최고인듯 하다   같이 먹고 싶어지는 비주얼과 정성  
日本人居ますか？？ 感想薄いんですけど、この動画素敵ですよね。なんかホッコリする。 そしてなんやあの糸…食ってみてぇ（＾ω＾ ≡ ＾ω＾）
오늘도 알수없는 유튜브의 메커니즘이 날 이끌었다   
the only down side to watching her videos is watering in the mouth while they all sit to eat in the end 
какие же, молодцы, трудяги просто    и кругом естественность и простота и в тоже время изысканность, мои восхищения и уважение    
this rotten tofu i was not used to it for the first time and was afraid of eating it the second time, i became addicted
the most peaceful thing i've ever seen  it was also very interesting, thank you
hey to the 1  reading this i hope your dreams come true and you go to heaven     my dream is to become a successful youtuber     god bless you ❤️
she is fairlady,she can do or teach us everything , also grandmother is so sweat ,i love both, love from nepal
this comes from someone who didnt have money for food and the only thing they had was that tofu  they said eat it, it wont hurt, put some sauce on it lol just like water on cereal  if you're hungry,  youll eat lol 
perfect girl perfect place
영상 보기만해도 힐링되고 좋아요😍
ふわふわしてておいしそう😋！動画の雰囲気凄い好き💓和む！
it is so sweet
マジで最初 パロディかなんかだと思ったけど ガチなんやな
一から手作りで美味しそう。プロフェッショナルだね✨  因みにフワフワの部分は発酵で出来たものかな？食べた事ないからよくわからない笑
덕분에 새로운 음식에 대해 알아가네요  감사합니다 
好作品，好的摄影师很重要
ahh yes, this is why i learned chinese  看起来很好吃
풍경이 정겨워서 보면 마음이 편해져요  요리가 한국이랑 다른 색다른게 많아서 재미있구요, 진짜 너무 좋아하는 채널ㅠㅠ
ничего не поняла, но прикольно 😅
한 번도 안 본 사람은 있어도 한 번만 본 사람은 없을 듯ㅋㅋㅋ
모털두부는 처음보네요  특이해요,  무슨맛일까요
아니 좀신기한게 두부보통  밖에서 놔두면바로쉬던데    두부썰어서밖에서 3일 그것도 비닐씌워서    두부가쉰거같은데곰팡이나는거면 먹어도되는건가   신기하네
i'm in love with her and liziqi😍💜😍
i've been living in china for 15 years, and i've never heard or seen hairy tofu   
പൂപ്പൽ നെ  ആണ് ഇവർ തുന്നണേ 🤭
i genuinely thought she was about to cook hamsters    those hairy tofus look cute 😍
first time watching her channel and she share almost similar village lifestyle with another girl  the one in red hood
আরে বাবা ছা ছা কি এসব খাস তুরা ওয়াক ওয়াক থু থু 🙊🙊🙊
so basically it’s a spicy fungus covered tofu    😂
everyday she walk so far to get something to cook, then eat together   here i'm from home order food by online,  then eat alone    😅
where did u learn to cook like this?              ???   hamoni ga hankook boon e sip       mi da 
شنو هذا رحمة البوج😁🧐
i love how you handle hot meals by putting/keeping them in metal/steel container  nowadays we're using plastics to put/keep hot meals which is not good for our body 
какя же она красавица, пока она готовила чуть не удавился своей слюной   смотрел тоже как готовят китайцы мне кажется вьетнамские блюда отличаются  так захотелось попробовать
where could i buy the preserving jars shown at the end of the video? the glass one you add water to the top of it to seal the food with 
ммм, жаренная плесень  вкусняшка  у меня в ванной такая же плантация произрастает 
i never heard about hairy tofu    😂
trump ??
我去云南的时候吃过一次这个！超级好吃！外酥里嫩
có ai người việt giống tui hông
you know so many great things   i am impressed each time i watch one of your videos     beautiful   🥘🍲🥗
có ai việt nam ở đây không
вот люди работяги  никакие продукты не пропадают  а нам иногда лень из полуфабрикатов приготовить
seeing her pour sauce on the hairy tofu is like watching someone pour sauce on the carpet 💀
these are the only people who eats rest of the world is just pretending

ジブリっぽい感じすき
두부 굳힐 때 간수가 아니라 석고넣는거 보고 신박했다  하긴 솔직히 주변이 산 인 것 같은데 간수 구하가 힘들겠지
this looks a lot like liziqi influence  i like watching these type of videos
いいなあああ〜 行ってみたい。。。中国
y’all    when this came up in my recommended   i was sure those were hamsters       i love tofu and this account and know it’s just fungus i’m so sorry but my brain just wouldn’t stop saying she holding a hamster
こんな素敵な暮らししてみたい😊

毛豆腐やんて初めて知った！美味しそう💓💓
hi i'm korean and i love this channel  your videos heal me and make me feel comfortable like an asmr video 
hairy food is also a special food of my province, it has really strong smell, so not everyone can accept it😂 i tried twice but still can’t
omg from the thumbnail i thought that was some rabbits or chicks
저런거나 쳐먹으니까 코로나에 걸리지 ㅉㅉ
마지막 병에 담그는건 전혀 예상안되는 전개들이야
прикольно  но я не поняла, это была плесень такая?
there's  something on my lawn that looks like this 
두부가 겁나 귀여워😻😻
한국어 자막이 있어서 너무 좋아요 
i thought from the thumbnail they were baby rabits
hairy tofu looks like jigglypuff 
why did i feel that she’s doing the exact same thing liziqi does? i mean, if it works for her, go ahead and do it 🤷🏻‍♀️👍🏼
이런 두부가 있다는걸 오늘 처음알고 가네요 ㅎㅎ 언제 꼭 한번 먹어보고 싶어요 ㅎㅎ
this was so satisfying to watch  my family owns a small local tofu company in hawaii and seeing this process was so cool and pure  thanks for sharing 
the girls working style is so lovely looks like a matured and experienced girl in cooking
毛豆腐 って言葉の威力σ ﾟдﾟ ｽｹﾞｪ

대단해요     멧돌에 완두콩 가는게 힘든되요 
that cough at 4 30 spook the shit out of me, watching this with ear bud on at 2 am       
this is so calming
i like your life  cozy, calm, friendly  life of the city is hard  i want to escape sometimes   
ちょっ…と見た目が衝撃的すぎるんだけど…  カビ生えてんのかこれ？
her cooking skills no doubt is like a fine art, so addictive and relaxing, but she seems to be a very trained and skilled chef, rather than an ordinary country girl as shown to be
its fungal growth on tofu   i cnt imagine eating something like this    but looking at this video i fell in love with this kind of lifestyle    so pure    
algum  brasileiro por aqui  nem sei como vim parar aqui 😂✌

everyone  oooo hairy tofu  me   rapeseed oil 
不便そうだけど羨ましい生活
毛の生えた豆腐…
最初みたときやべぇって思ったけどつくる過程みると手間かかってて普通に美味しそう。 納豆菌とかと一緒なんかな？
뭔진 모르겠는데 두부가 디게 귀여운 솜뭉텅이 같어 궁금하니까 먹어보고 십다 캬
that was soo much satisfying to see ❤️
納豆的な感じか！
your mom and dad should be so proud of you having a good lady

the traditional way of chinese cooking is amazing even though i hate tofu
wonder who was the first to think of eating hairy tofu  it takes some courage to discover 
i’m just shocked idk what to say i have respect for what i just saw omg just respect
毛豆腐 taste like cheese, i searched  i hope it try   
썸네일보고 병아리인 줄 알고 식겁해서 허버허버 들어옴 ㅠㅠ두부였네
thank you for the korean subtitles ♡♡♡
中国人、犬とか猫食べない食文化みれてよかった……
i'm afraid their throats will itch from the molds they ate lol 
не знаю что я посмотрела,но это прекрасно даже эта мохнатая штука как внеземная еда 
at first i though what she was holding was hamsters  _ 
before i read the title, i was like omg noo what is she gonna do with those baby chicks😭
超うまそうじゃん！ いつか食べてみたいね
vids like these are just completely calming and amazing   subbed for more upcoming vids
どの国も田舎の伝統的な料理風景は素晴らしいね  º▿º

今天很有幸看见你的视频，一看就看了很多集，很欣赏你的手艺和本领，确实领我大开眼界，在这里给你再多个赞，加油期待你的新作品，美丽又善良的云南美女。
i’ve never even heard of hairy tofu until now lmao
i always love watching you do your magic, but honestly i'd be too afraid to eat something hairy that i left out for 3 or more days 😖
thank you for the great video once again  i can't wait for the translation  😐
