I'm my thirty years of existence I never knew that theres a hairy tofu.
I like the way you film your video but Ican't eat this things
Nobody notices the great camera work and editing? Kudos to the people behind these amazing videos
Immediate reaction:  THATS MOLD
Idk if I'm being weird or something but those hairy tofu look so cute
I have this weird urge to keep one of those tofus as a pet...
띵동 한국인을 발견하셨습니다
They should’ve named it cotton tofu it sounds more appetizing than hairy tofu
두부도 털이나는데 시팔 내머리카락은..
우연히 보게되어서 지금 정주행중인데 와... 정말 플라스틱이 하나도 안보이네요;; 영상은 힐링 그 자체입니다
I thought those were baby chickens at first 😂🤣
Everything looks easy on YOUTUBE but in reality; this life style is extremely hard.  If you have to think about the processes.  I hope you know that it took a few days and lots of work.
I want to know who first looked at mouldy tofu and went “I’m gonna eat this”
유튜브 알고리즘은 정말 진심으로 이해를 못하겠어...




한국인 없냐
I feel like theres just a small community of these fairies that live somewhere in the mountains, self sufficient, and multitalented with the most aesthetic shots and perfect editing, making things you’ve only dreamt you had the motivation, talent, and patience to do.
So amazing place to live..
Fresh air and a great family i really want to live in a village like you because in the big city i cant see mountain or big tree all i can see is dust and smoke..
Say hi for your family love from bali.❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sis makes me want to live on the mountains and build a farm
이 영상이 왜 추천에 떴는지는 모르겠지만 아무튼 유튜브 추천은 훌륭하다. 영상 퀄리티보고 바로 구독하게되네. 그리고 수많은 유튜브 채널이 있지만 이 채널에는 뭔가 고유한 느낌이 있는데 그게 좋네.
Wha... I thought it was bunnies in the thumbnail...
이거ㅠ보니까 그 생각난다 새벽 여섯 시에 일어나 콩밭에 가서 콩 털어 할머니 밥 차려드려 그리고 해떨어지면 자빠져 자 또 새벽 여섯 시에 일어나 콩 밭 가서 콩 털어 또 두부 처만들어
I though on the thumbnail were baby chickens
 I am confiusion
over here that hairy tofu wouldve been consider “expired” 😂😂😂
중국판 리틀포레스트 느낌 물씬 난다... 조용하고 한가롭고 따뜻한 단편영화를 한 편 보고 난 기분.
Just gonna assume that the "hair" is a type of mold?
Who else thought they were baby chickens in the thumbnail.
I’m kinda grateful that I don’t have to put this much effort into making food because if I did, my lazy ass would be starving.
i really want to taste this hairy tofu and am totally disgusted at the same time...
The beauty of it is that she made everything from scratch. From farm to food on the tabl. An art in itself
i feel transported to a different world when i watch these videos
이 영상은 주기적으로 와서 두부 튀기는거 까지 봐야함
When it said “hairy tofu” my biomed degree immediately SCREAMED
진짜 힐링 그 자체... 근데 갑자기 이게 왜 떴는지 알수 없음...
I clicked on this cause I thought they were kittens.
This is so much better than watching two dudes build a pool in the middle of the woods
people in the comment is talking about how they wouldn’t eat a mouldy tofu, but it’s the same thing like cheese or beer. It all goes through the process of fermentation. I think this tofu is delicious and everyone should try it. It’s really creamy.
The bigger question here is what does it even taste like ? I'm so curious
There's other Chinese girl named Liziqi who did the same thing...her cooking skills was amazing!
*For some reason i thought she was eating a hamster*
No one:.....
literally no one:
Philippine vendors: TahOoOoooOoooOoOOo!!
To be honest if your saying hairy tofu is disgusting then I would like to say it’s on the same level of cheese and beer.
발효시키면서 나오는 곰팡이같은데..
곰팡이맞죠?

청국장도 , 메주도 그런씩으로 발효시키니
유익균이다 볼수있겠어요.
두부에 털난거 귀엽다 ㅋㅋㅋ큐ㅠㅠㅠ 짚단같은데서 숙성하는거 보니까 일종의 곰팡이..? 균으로 만드는건가
If I ever get a white fluffy dog I’m naming it tofu.
This is some ghibli level stuff!
Hairy tofu looks like baby chicks🐥🐤🦆
mold: *forms on tofu to make it bad*
humans: *eats tofu and enjoys it*
mold: am I a joke to you
that's fungus on the top...
I really admire Chinese cuisine ... The food is obviously delicious but what's admiring is the process of cooking. Meticulous and skillful
뭐야? 완전 신기해... 털이라길래 .. 그냥 조금 있겠지 했는데, 완전 솜털 같다...우와..😲
정감가면서도 스피디하면서도 이국적이면서도 리틀포레스트같으면서도 신기하면서도 좋은영상이네요
Youtube : wanna watch Several way to eat hairy tofu

Me : I don't need sleep , I need an answer
이렇게 보니 도리깨, 키, 맷돌 같은 농기구들이 우리나라랑 거의 유사하네. 같은 아시아권이라 비슷한듯
Tbh I came here thinking this was Liziqi's channel
Am I the only one who thinks the girl is stunningly beautiful!?
1:45 두부에 석고넣는거 처음보고 문화충격 먹어서 검색하고 알아보느라 1시간 날아갔다...

결론= 식용석고를 쓴다지만 석고두부 많이 먹으면 신장결석 생김

你好，姐姐
I come from Vietnam 💖🇻🇳💖
I was watching a video about Jaclyn Hill lipsticks then this showed up lmaooo. Hairy.
Sorry,  but hairy tofu is something I’m going to pretend doesn’t exist.
