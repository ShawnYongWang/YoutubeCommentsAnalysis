You inspired me to clean my room today, sounds stupid but ive been depressed for  years now, lived in pure garbage land and today... I cleaned, threw away alot a shit and took a shower hahaha thank you
Its all very cool, but these people have some lands Theres so much abundance of everything. They are rural rich. Its not easy to have that lifestyle.
, she ran back to cover her hears and jumped as well, that was cute but funny XD
The cinematography and editing is extremely professional The theme sounds like from Laputa castle in the sky.

Mmmm sugared up hawthorn fruit on a stick....good memories with my mum and sister. I miss China

This video is so simple, yet so beautiful. So calming. Also, dogs.

We lost nature living,  Thats really beautiful
Honestly what even is my life compared to this. Wtf. Ive done nothing and learned nothing. And shes over here doing hundreds of different things in all these videos

THIS is an influencer.
Her life is so productive while me laying at bed all day because of quarantine and watch her vids.
watching her videos is like replaying my childhood. I can almost relate many things in the video that my mom did for me and my family when I was growing up. How lucky I am as her daughter.
Liziqi

Im blown away by what I just watched. I dont know what to say..thank you
All the cute little animals following her everywhere
Shes like a Disney princess.. but better because she can do anything

Normal Person Oh hey, a chestnutLiziqi I can make like  dishes from this.
 Fc
everyone looking at the mukbang me looking at the dog
Her channel is the purest thing Ive ever come across on YouTube.
Im  and this girl inspired me to do this , she is so hardworking love from Vietnam 
This is not just food in making. This is asthetic art 
she was more scared than granny by the popcorn machine release but still covered her grannys ear instead of her own xD cute
Wow, Talk about living a life with purpose. This is beautiful. The satisfaction you get from making with your own hands.
     .    . .
Theyre so cute. She is petite but she is so strong. Shes been doing all the work since small , thats why her hand is like  magic
Li Ziqi has a touching life story. She is an orphan raised by her grandma. After leaving her village at age , she tried many jobs, including waitress, DJ and bar singer. She return to her village in  to take care of her aging grandma and started to make Vlogs to sell her farm products initially. Her Vlogs became an instant success in China.
Her cooking and Juns cooking has this same type of elegant and homey feeling to it. It just, makes me fall in love with cooking.
even a millionier will feel jealousy with your lifestyle dear...very hardworking girl. 
       ,      
How cute is the lamb just like a dog 
Im  seconds in and the puppies and the lamb following her like wtf how can this be so cute
im waiting liziqi gonna bake some cake or do some research of others country food. will be more instrested.
I love that the sheep and the dogs follows her around

i love how there are puppies and a lamb following her at the beginning uwu
      .
Are we going to talk about how big those mangos were Edit 
When she got scared of the popcorn machine 
Her and her grandma would live comfortably through a zombie apocalypse. She even has a wall surrounding her house.
I feel ashamed as a girl. shes beautiful, independent, and skillful
        
Omgosh only if we can all live eat like this young lady, well all live at least until  or older... beautiful
Omg can we talk about how adorable she was at popcorn popping I M DYING
This is the life. What a simply beautiful way to live
Where is it i wanna see this place with my own eyes 
Shes like a Disney princess with all the animals I love her little lamb
honest living ...wish I could leave everything behind and live there
I love your videos  Please feed your little dogs.  They always look so hungry
Sis makes me want to live on the mountains and build a farm
The way the little animals follow her around... shes already a princess 
I wanna be like her.. Please, its so productive and she is so hard worker
Seems like she has a more fulfilling life that most of working to pay bills
That is my dream life style 
Shes so elegant and hardworking, and there I am, hungry but too lazy to get off the couch to get some snacks
therapy expensive watching ziqis videos free
The puppies and the lil lamb are following her everywhereD so cute

when everything is so perfect it almost feels unreal and like a fantasy. Those people who think her labour is fake, i guess theyre so used to getting dissapointment from life, that its unreal to them that one girl can be so amazing and live in a life that looks like a fantasy.
 She tried to protect her grandmother but got scared herself . This is too adorable
The sheep was so cute
When she ran to go cover her grandmothers ear, that was the most caring and the most heartwarming  thing I have ever seen 
Lizqi I did not realize you could fried peanuts in dirt Im going to try it. Im also going to make healthy marshmallow snowflake candy and see how it turns out. Thank you for always having such interesting food and how to make things so simply and so ingenious
Heaven way of living 
Whos getting jealous by watching this
I feel like she gonna bring peace to the earth
I feel lazy after watching everyone work so hard.
I feel so useless when i see her doing her thing... lovely 
Still looking for that wardrobe I have to walk through to get to this magical place.....
By any chance the place you live is called HEAVEN 
The last time I wanted this, this video only have around  or  millions of views. And now, it have  Million views I am glad that more people are discovering her and appreciating her efforts.
The part where she literally dropped everything to cover her grandmas ears and then she gets scared
En qu pas vives Qu pas vives, por favor
I m coming across the great wall just to meet this lady.
         
  
Her covering her grandmas ears instead of hers but being more scared than her grandma is so cute
Dude she would be a good Studio Ghibli heroine..
I love yours every things...
I want to live this type life . 
Que coisa mais bela. Quero uma vida assim tbm
Her grandmother is absolutely adorable, everytime I see her in wintery episodes shes always bundled up in the cutest jackets and hats
You can make popcorn like that Amazingg
This is life should be. No war no drama no unnecessary pressure
liziqi.
 those little dogs and sheep walking behind her is so cute tho 
Everyday must be iWatch your channel morning and night  good djob god bless you  you and your family love you from Morocco 
SHE DESERVES WAY MORE THAN MICHELIN STARS  SHES ANOTHER LEVEL Ramsey will never get to her level 
Instead of meeting a Hollywood movie star, Id rather meet you. Bravo for finding the purer essence of life.
  
She is so connected with nature like any human supposed to be. Sad that we totally lost our connection with nature and its raw energy. Thats why we are angry and depressed in the cities.
I admire her work ethic.  I wouldnt be able to do anything without running my mouth or sweating.  The grease wouldve popped me while cooking and Im a weenie so Id be bitching about that.  My dog would be begging to be picked up, lambs hollering, just a country mess.
Shes the ideal woman  decent clothing hardworking.......and that place is just awesome... thats where I wanna live 
I love when the animals follow her around wherever she goes  they look so happy and excited
          
Those mango cones look yummy

Peanut sesame brittle
Roasted chestnuts
Popcorn
Salty sunflower seeds
Fried peanuts
Crispy fried egg roll egg liquid g, milk g, plain flour g, honey, granulated sugar g, corn oilunsalted butter g
Snowflake crisp nonstick pan important, marshmallow g, milk powder g, cranberry, chestnuts, cookies, dried strawberries, corn oilunsalted butter g. The ratio of marshmallow, milk powder and butter is so important. The crisp will not be so hard or too soft, but chewy at the right ratio. 
When uncle opened the corn popper Ziqi runs to cover grandmas ears, then jumps and screams herself.This was so cute, how can I not smile and be happy
I too want to live a life where there is no one to interfere in my life where I could grow vegetables myself before my meal in my small farm and there is no needless peeping around. i get irritated by people who peep at me. they do not believe in living life peacefully, but spend their lives in mischiefs of others.
Wow Super woman...  so efficient...  She and her family will never go  hungryDoes she ever stop.  I get tired just watching her preparing and prepping  food all day long.  The food always looks so delicious and professionally prepared. Thankyou for inviting us into your living space
Why are we going to war when there is so much to enjoy peacefully from mother nature

I wanna see her feed the pups cause shes straight up ignoring the cuties
i love the popcorn part shes trying to cover her grandmas ears
My god, I love this channel Everything looks so perfect.
,      ,   
 so cute when shes obviously a afraid of explosion but still covers her grandmothers ears 
This is better to watch than any kind of hollywood movies
I would love to visit and just be immersed into their everyday culture. These videos bring my soul so much peace and happiness.
Her videos came to my attention by my yearold daughter, she loved watching her videos on YouTube. Now we are watching it together and we both are fascinated and aweinspiring by her works, we are learning Mandarin and this video will help us to know a little more about the traditional Chinese food etc.
The cinematography, the content, the editing skills. This is the most perfect video in youtube.
shes got quality control for sure
I feel guilty watching this video and there isnt a single ad. Some people make worst content and run ads about every minute or two.
   
John  For God so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten Son Jesus Christ, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish, but have eternal life. 
As a Chinese,I am really happy to see people from different countries appreciate and love ziqis video.

My grandmother even has the same skills as you, she knows how to planting, cooking and making some useful tools. Im so glad that you introduce our traditional rural lifestyle to the people all over the world. And let them know there are not only Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in China, but also a land of abundance which last a unique lifestyle for more than thousand years, and named Sichuan, also the land of heaven in Chinese. But I cant back to Sichuan because of exams this year, and your video will accompany with me in the chinese new year. Support from a Chinese and Szechuanese in Italy. Happy Chinese New Year

Thanks 
If you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about Liziqi  Li Ziyi 

In , Li Ziyi fell to the ground in Mianyang, Sichuan. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Later, her father died, and Li Ziyi became an orphan. His stepmother didnt treat her well. Li Zizhen mentioned on Weibo that he had had a halfdead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten.

Grandpa and Grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take Li Ziyu home and live. When Li Ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. At the age of , Li Ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an year wandering life. Her first life was very hard. She slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months.

Li Ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of  yuan. In order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. Later, when talking about the matter, Li Zizhen frankly said I didnt say that I liked music at that time, just to live, I felt that it was well paid.

In , because grandma was ill once, Li Ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. Being closer, I feel more at ease.

After returning, Li Ziyi opened a Taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. In , under the influence of his younger brother, Li Ziyi was exposed to the short video platform Meipai. Until , seeing that his younger brother had some fans on Meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of Taobao business, Li Ziyi reentered Meipai to prepare for his own video program.

The reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment.

In an interview with the living room of Sina Club, Li Ziyi mentioned, All these things that are selfsufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. In the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places.

In the beginning, Li Ziyi gave himself a topic called Four Seasons Change, Eat While You Eat. After the suggestion of Meipai editor, it became Ancient Food and it is still used today.

In September , a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for Li Ziyu to get more attention in the future. Sina Weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support.

As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Liu Tongming brought her Weibo resources support.

One day in September , Li Feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private Weibo message from Mr. L. Mr. L expressed his love for Li Ziyus video content, felt that he had fulfilled his Taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her.

For a long time after that, Li Ziyi received Mr. Ls private letter. It would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. This is usChinas proud traditional culture should be seen by people in China and around the world. Mr. L said in a private message.

At first, after seeing these private messages, Li Ziyi didnt care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. Until one day, Mr. L came to the city where Li Zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. Mr. Ls politeness and clear logical thinking made Li slowly drop his initial alert.

This accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of Li Zizhen. Not long after the meal was over, with the help of Mr. L, Li Zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on Sina Weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing Li Zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head.

This experience is partly recorded in a diary of Li Zizheng that year. Some insiders close to the senior executives of Weinian Technology confirmed to Tencents Shenwang that the Mr. L is actually Liu Tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. Daxiong Liu, the founder of Wei Nian Technology, an MCN company to which Li Zizhen now belongs.

On December th, the reading volume of a Weibo topic labeled Is Li Ziyi a cultural output climbed to  million. Li Zizheng was once again on the hot search list.

The video created by Li Ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now.

Extensive overseas communication is an important reason for Li Zihuans renewed attention. Some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional Chinese culture and cuisine. Others think that her video is not completely true To reflect Chinas rural life.

Even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a DJ, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life Its still just a fiction for character setting.

An insider of Weinian Technology told Tencents Deep Web that Li Ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by Li Ziyi himself. The popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. In fact, both Li Zihuan and the microreading team behind him were quite lowkey, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs.

Until August , , Li Ziyis eponymous Tmall store officially opened. Six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over , and sales of over  million. A year later, the total sales of  products displayed in the Li Zizhen flagship store exceeded . million, with total sales reaching  million.
The value behind Li Ziyis IP is being quickly tapped.

Li Ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. But now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements.
According to Tianyan search, Deep Web shows that MCN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., which Li Ziyi belongs to, was established on February , , with a registered capital of RMB . million. According to the introduction, Wei Nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates KOL into IP through short videos and extends to consumer brands.

The information of Qixinbao shows that there are more than  pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark Li Zihuan. The applicant companies are Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd. The product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, Financial property management, catering and accommodation.

Not only that, Wei Nian also has inextricable links with Li Ziyus companies.

According to the eye inspection, Li Jiajia should be the original name of Li Ziyu established Sichuan Ziyu Culture Communication Co., Ltd. on July , , and Wei Nian is its shareholder, holding  of the shares. Supervisor, Li Jiajia holds  of the shares.

According to other data, there are as many as  beneficiary companies behind Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., including Greenland Holdings, ZTE, Xinhua Media, Vanke, Light Media, etc. .
Among the shareholders of Weinian Technology, Sina Weibo is particularly eyecatching.

From Wei Nian Technology to Sina Weibo, Li Ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to.
In her own words, she changed from a little transparent to a person who is so useless to society. After entering the public view and being noticed by more people, Li Ziyis sense of responsibility has also become heavier.
I want to do what I can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, nonheritage cultural craftsmen, and I want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. Li Ziyi said.

Her videos are what I use to unwind at the end of a long day and helps me see things in a new perspective.

thank you for sharing your daily life through videos and making people jealous of your life  and realize that life is beautiful. this world is beautiful without war. Greetings of peace 


Hiii i watched this video times. I want to visit ur village
I wish to try some of the snacks.
Liziqi, youre such an inspiration to me  Love your videos  There is so so much to be learned from you. Sending you lots of love and light.  just small detail, there is a sunflower seeds not melon seeds used in video  
  ,  
she behaves like a K Drama heroineLovely 
You are a LEGEND Liziqi I miss this kind of life. Your place is a paradise, surrounded by flowers and vegetables, and your cute friends. I like your Puppy and the lamb. Your Popo is so lucky to have you with her, a very loving grand daughter. I love all your videos. I will try your recipes from scratch. Also, i love your Oven. Its unique. Love from Houston, TexasMimi 
This is a wonderland and she is a wow queen of it
Wait a minute... isnt you tube is banned in China, I think its illegal in China to use you tube
Liziqi

I love this episode....Ive watched it many times. I wish I had recipes for each thing
YouTube, sometimes I question the things you recommend to me. This isnt one of them. Thank you for this, this is lovely.
This channel is really awe inspiring. From the cooking and food presentation, and the music chosen. Totally transports me to a fantastical realm. The production is really top quality. Super fan here thank you
    ,  
I rewatched the part where the popcorn machine exploded so many times, watching Liz cover her grandmas ears and jump was so funny
Happy Chinese New year my motivated girl  wish you luck in your life.
I just found a virtual paradise  This is so beautiful. 

Ngon tht
This girl is a perfect miracle... A hard past and now look at her... Shes living a happier life... She is my idol 
She is the real life disney princess...her life so full of life ...i love the part where she ran towards her grandma to close her ears
Her youtube channel is only  year old and she already has M subscribers and more that M views on every single video, some of them have more that M views.This girl is amazing 
Meanwhile, Im all Ugh, I cant believe its taking so long when my Ubereats order hasnt come yet
Shes so strong. Those baskets balanced on her shoulders are heavy. Pomelos and ponkans are watery fruits, and theyre really heavy.
.. if she is a dream then i dont want to wake up..

After watching this  I hate my life and I feel like Im not healthy at all

Sheeps following along with the dogs are too cute
That moment when she covers her grandmas ear so that the grandma will not startle but turns out shes the one who actually startled 
She is amazing, but so many negative comments about your own lives.. you have to find your own balance and beauty in your life It doesnt have to be escaping the city life completely, or getting rid of technology.Make time for what makes you happy next to your work and responsibilities. Shes decided that this is her way to happiness.You might think that you need this, but you could be wrong. Life is long enough to find out whatll make you feel accomplished, we just need to stand up and start to search
best youtyouber i like you so much

The puppies and lamb following you are so cute. Such well behaved little cuties. Poor puppies got scared of the popcorn machine. So precious
 When she called the Uncle selling popcorn, that was so precious. Reminds me of when I was in the province, whenever an ice cream or bread selling uncle pass by, I would shout loud to call them.
Fairy tales type of girl, beautiful hardworking...You are real Cinderella...Your house, garden , forest., Utensils , everything is like a fairy tale story...
What a intresting video

...     ,                ....I love you very much, even though I am Korean, but I do not have a difference because I do not differentiate between the two countries. Rather, they must be united by love and sincerity, but some people do not support that.... ...                .                 ....Koreli olmama ramen seni ok seviyorum, ama hibir farkm yok nk iki lke arasnda ayrm yapmyorum.  Bunun yerine, sevgi ve samimiyetle birlemelidirler, ancak baz insanlar bunu desteklemez....     ,     ,                   ,         ,        ...

Wow. She is a hardworking young lady and beautiful. She was so cute when she went to cover her grandmas ears.  then she was the one who jumped. Lol.

Amazing thats  how we used to buy pop corn or pop rice. I would bring corn or rice to a street vendor and he would make it using that machine. The moment when he opened the machine is so thrilling to a kid

she prepared food for Chinese New Year
Natural but great production.
I used to have sleeping problems and most of the time I just couldnt sleep, not even a wink but since I started watching her videos, my mind was more at ease. Her videos are so soothing. She calms me down, im speechless

Never seen such a calm face even with that much hard work
When i was a lil girl i had a book of chinese folk tale written in Bengali which was very close to my heart.There was a girl in that story who used to stay with her granny in a beautiful villlage of China .She too used have a gang of pet...She would also do many household chores just like this girl and her lifestyle was my childhood fantasy..I used have a pretend play just like the lifestyle of that girl mentioned in the story....when I watch this channel I feel very much nostalgic to see this pretty girl and her life....She is an amazing girl...God bless her and her granny..

The best Chinese culture  ambassador, thousands love from Nigeria 
Shes so cute when she cover her grandmas ears, but when the pop corn pops she jumps. She also surprises her grandma with that kind of crispy hot cake or whatever you call it. Shes so sweet 
And why people compare her with Disney Princess  She is much more than that 
She is a brilliant girl because she knows everything. She is hardworking girl.
This video makes me want to live in that peaceful village instead of crowd city
Every time i feel lazy. I watch this girl and it inspires me to work harder..
Her dogs and lamb is always beside her. Lil pals ^^
That lil pup deserves to relish that stuff.
Probably her videos are the only ones I watch without skipping. Because I would be completely mesmerized by her work.
Those puppies are soooo cute

Shes getting more and more beautiful living in such peaceful and fresh area.

I love those puppies that follow her everywhere  so cute
Thats the most beautiful thing Ive ever seen on youtube 
I cant stop watching. TASTY better watch out
Shes like a Disney character
When you got everything you need in your backyardforest. Demn
Shes so cute tho like she can cook, loving, caring her grandmapa such beautiful granddaughter and wife material 
So this is what ONE WITH EVERYTHING FEELS LIKE.
I have insurmountable respect and admiration for this woman. Not just from what I see in the videos, but the fact shes bringing back to new life an archaic way of doing things. Because of her Ive learned a lot about culture, process and reaction. Also because of her, Ive gained several new skills.
Im so happy to see someone who can show the the different life of Chinese people, neither just the miserable one in some Chinese movies and western news, nor modern good life in some big cities from Chinese media. From the comments, I found most of us, no matter where are you from, share the similar value and aesthetics. We are not so different.
I love how she love her grandma so much. 
Very hardworking young lady. A very busy day.
Wanted to cook something...but instead i ended up looking at this beautifull girl for more thank  h  Im just in love with this channel  Congrats 
All the love from India 
 
                 
The picture quality is so good. Not to forget, this girls cooking and handicrafts skill is great too.

What is your name
            
Is this how she really lives Wow... must be nice....
I just thought to myself this is beautiful when I saw the beginning but when the Digimon music actually kicked in at  I genuinely fell in love with this channel.
How the heck did this come in my recommendationBut soo beautiful tho woww
Happy Chinese New Year Beautiful Lady and to Popo  Im so inlove with all your videos... Well Done
Beautiful..talented..respectful to her elders knows how to do EVERYTHING..if the apocalypse ever happens Im looking for her
I find this so interesting and relaxing. I dont understand all the dislikes...

Like her personality she is full of energy and so talented with everything no matter what if it is cooking or hard labor.Your pets are so adorable.
What is hwthrow

K dislike Im sorry for them. Come on. The animals love her too. That should tell you something

,.
She is like a dream princess. Best of luck dear.From,Bangladesh.
Everything she does is just poetry in motion bless her
Ive binge watched this beautiful womens videos for the past hour and Im just at awe by how much she knows.
Gordon Ramsay would absolutely fall in love with this place if he ever visited her. True cooking from scratch

  

she just inspire everyone to live a simple but a meaningful happy life ..
After seeing this, I can attest that Chinese food and culture is great I am originally from India btw
Theres something so serene and beautiful about the way she works
This is literally how Chinese people lived back in the past, as technology improves, less people live like this. its amazing that a women like her still continues to do things the traditional way, it reminds me of the past. You can tell from traditional old Chinese buildings, its amazing, all handmade, people back then are so damn smart. Now people all uses machines for everything, and yes its efficient, but it feels different.
How can anyone dislike her effort and creativity.Humans r so annoying somethimes.
She owes this to her grandpa. She must have been remembering him while making this furniture. Dont you think 
I cant believe what I am seeing. This girl is incredible.
i am thoroughly convinced she is a forest spirit living with an old tree spirit
I need to go buy a Billy to IKEANobodyLiziqi hold my bamboo
Me making face masks, proud of myself.Her another level.
When a guy say girls cant build anything without their help
She has an angelic look and Im fascinated by her craftsmanship and strength. Her grandmother approved. Maybe she learned the skills from her.
Ikea We make the best furniture in the world.Liziqi Hold my Bamboo
Ill just go ahead and say it I am so in love with this woman. Is it all legit or a bit fake I dont care. Sometimes one just has to take something at face value and enjoy it for what it is. In her videos I see the way we are supposed to live.
This beautiful  young lady has some serious carpentry skills...Lovely too watch her use some ancient Chinese carpentry methods to build those fantastic looking furniture items. May you live a long life and prosper in your heritage....

That plant is a bless, specially for DIYers. We wish Bamboo grew all around the world. 
I like how feminine and strong and disciplined she is.
We should have more strong and respectful female figures on YouTube like her.


hey i want to leave in that place with u its quite peaceful environment.
Me I need new sofa. Goes to IKEAHer I need new sofa. Goes to forest
  
I laughed at the end when she was like, Oh wait, let me go get changed.
Eres maravillosa Todava no creo que sos real,,puedo creer que sos mgica Gracias 

During interview,Boss So what can you do Ziqi Yes.




I hate when ppl reduce her only to a cooking channel. Shes an engineer, a homemaker, the ultimate DIY channel imo

I heard from her older fans that before she did these type of calmcountrylife videos she made woodworkinghandicraft tutorial videos and honestly I belive them

What a beautiful scenery and a comfortable lifestyle is a dream that many people have always wanted to pursue.
I feel like even her grandma is amazed by her granddaughters many talents.




Read her story from online.Her parents passed away when she was a kid. She was raised by her grandparents in rural countryside. Her grandpa passed away when she was . Her grandma didnt have enough money to raise her. So, she left home to look for jobs.  years after, her grandma was sick. She moved back home to take care of her grandma...Tried many things, she discovered a way for living by making videos and food blogger. Her success is not only her talents, but also she courage and spirit  never give upOnly a person who truly love life can make such beautiful artistic pieces.

Thank you YouTube recommendations I didnt know I needed this in my life

This is so beautiful, as is everything you touch You have such a gift, with plants and with people. So much love inside of your soul.  You truly take away my anxiety when I watch your videos. I appreciate the calmness and feeling at one with nature.  Your videos provide that to us all.

Her videos make me want to drop everything,  move to rural China and make my own everything
This is whats real inspiration for me, nowadays we got technology and developped things so we kinda lazy compared the the past generation, Even tho Im from GenZ but I love hardwork and everything handmade cuz I feel that way u will be  proud of everything u made by u and only u.One day I will have my own house, farm,and everything made by me..
This was the first video I saw from her Im still amazed...
When society collapses, this lady and her family will be living the high life
Mind bogglingIs there no end to her talentsShe does everything so effortlessly. 
An intelligent girl with great ideas and hardworking nature. God bless.

She works always like a nonstop machine .... Nd to see her videos I realize that how much lazy I am
She is very creative with nature if we are a creative person like her we dont need to buy things much
I like how at the end after setting up all her Beautiful furniture pieces she asks her grandma what she thinks about her pillows.

I like how this was randomly in my recommended box, thanks YouTube
Liziqi or whoever edited this should make a movie because damn I feel like I just went through a spiritual journey with this bamboo couch
This is amazing and her talent takes me on to another level. Do we have humans like this still in existinance. I rest my case  and feel embarrassed of myself . This talent and hard work somehow needs to be passed on to our lazy south africans

When I saw the thumbnail few days ago in my recommendations, I thought maybe its some sort of short clips of drama videos so never clicked. I wasnt expecting this... She is so cool...
THE BACKGROUND SOUND IS SO ASMR TYPE SO PEACEFULL
Not to sound dramatic but being an artist and seeing her work until the sun came down , I cried,  I love how art can make us forget about everything around us and in the end that work created something really beautiful.
what a magnifisicent woman  her spirit so bright

Is there anything this woman cant do Im so amazed by her talents and skills
Amazingly beautiful place and really pretty girl doing incerdible stuff. Feels like another world.

GREECE        liakos gr Neo petritsi  serron
My dad saw this and was so excited.He was born in Hunan China in , a province next to where this girl lives.  He couldnt believe this little girl made furniture that he remembers sleeping on during summer to escape the heat when he was a child.He was impressed that she made it with he same finesse as the old masters did when he saw them do the work.He left home before he turned into an adult to fight the communist and lived most of his life in Taiwan as an R.O.C. veteranTeacher, and he hasnt seen furniture like this, made in such a way, since he left his childhood homeSo... this is legit
I have been working my bamboo house in my durian garden, I wish u would be my wife....that is helpfull babe...
Eating what u grow  amazingHaving tea on a freashly made bench made by you  next lvl
This is absolutely incredible
It is impressive No workbench, no complex machinery, literally handmade
What kind of creature could not like this
Sorry li ziqu really sorry i am from india and the relationship between india and China is not too good In my old memories I realy hate Chinese but after watching youI really really like chinese.... I learn that they are not too bad I you are heart by my words please really sorry Love from india 
My grandma have the same when she was young her and her sister always play chess using a cap of pastic bottle until she had sooo many bamboos
Cant believe ppl like her still exist in this artificial generation
As a woodworker myself, its interesting to see the way the same tecniques are utilized on such a different material to achieve a very flattering result. In particular, i liked the heat bending for the bamboo table.Its all very simple, nothing particularly difficult. But these simple tecniques and materials are used to achieve a great result.
Oh my god I cant even assemble IKEA furniture properly 
    
there is so much work and discipline in this video, but you are so graceful that it seems effortless...
And here I am still trying put together this ikea piece

See. It does exist. Femininity, physicality, and master craftsmanship. True beauty.
A lot of respects to Liziqui 
Was expecting her to fly through the bamboo forest on the way back.

Eu sou do Brasil e dei 
Wow the atmosphere is amazing and beautiful. All the flowers and trees 
This girl is amazing
Youre very talented Very calming video. Great to see resourceful craftsmanship. Thanks for sharing
Beauty with brain
Nobody YouTube recommendations Lmao you wanna see how to build a bamboo sofa 
Youre so hard working girl really
and I think getting up to charge my phone is hard work
Shes so breathtakingly beautiful, one half of my family comes from her province. The south all along the Yangtze is so beautiful too, having grown up in the northwest corner near the border of Kazakhstan, I really wish I grew up here instead.
Omg shes so talented n amazing..Nice nice
GENUINELY one of the most fascinating things ive ever watched.

All her movements are very quick and energetic, but incredibly precise. Amazing to watch a master at work.
Kesini gara berita di tv
Bro this was incredible The amount of patience this had to have taken is unreal. Props to this girl who committed to making these beautiful masterpieces.
Full makeup, money spent on stuff, following the useless ephemeral in daily life make everyone ashamed here. She seems one of the most beautiful girls even without heavy makeup and decorating herself. The aura of true princess is somewhere your heart knows, your talents that shine through all your life and the one next to you.
So amazing 
No words for your efforts girl,Hats off on you
Shes beauty, shes grace. Shes got a way with her hands  Princess 
I put off cleaning my shower for like  days coz I cant be assed, meanwhile she has built a houseful of furniture, formented enough food to last a year and cooked  amazing meals from scratch. She is my hero 
You are intelligent and extraordinary..Love from Bangladesh
People who disliked works in IKEA
I want a girlfriend like her, just amazing 
Shes the perfect example of I can do everything
Words cannot express how happy I was to find this beautiful channel. My mother died last week totally unexpectedly and watching your videos is cleansing my soul. Thank you from the bottom of my heart x
she carries that all the way alone my goodness, wish I could give her a hand though she might not need any.she is one hell outta superwoman
Im here complaining about the instructions on how to build a trampoline
Bear Grylls I can survival in this forest for a month. Liziqi hold on, let me build a city here.
M
Me The perfect girl doesnt exis...YouTube Recommemded
Not only being a talented chef, carpenter, artist and so on,  Ziqi also demonstrated her bravery of conquering any difficulty with her bare hands, and in a skillful and graceful way. For kids living in cities nowadays, Ziqi is a precious role model for them.
Do you ever look at a comment and realize, Man, that wouldve been a great idea.
Incredible Im glad I came across this video.
I was about to type she needs to make pillows and then she started making pillows
Straight to the point and no edmThis is 
And I complain about assembling my IKEA side table....which I STILL manage to screw up somehow.
Shes so gorgeous and the way she works just captivates me. 
   ,             

this might sound weird but you doing these things make me happy to be alive
Maturity comes when one accept dislike  ignore it.
Heres the translationI have been wanting to buy a sofa set but a good eye catching set costs over k RMB. Then last week I remembered my grandpa made a sofa set before. So I took his idea and try to make it. This is bamboo season, ideal to use to make a back basket, a chair and a rack and will not get infested with bugs. I made a back basket, a folding fan and a tray before but never made a sofa set. I made a lot of mistakes but with trial and error I finally made a monk bed, an empress chair and a tea table. Very happy, very happy. Coming from a smilely person who just saved a ton of money.

I find no words...Only Respect...
Oh, god, im so sorry. Bless his sweet and accomplished and something very beautiful who is himself like him to be like him lake lake lake lake come on
But honestly she got mad Crafting skill, here me with all kind of equipment and machine but cant even build a simple box
She uses that Cleaver for everything. Where can I buy one
I love of all Liziqis videos She is a true Spirited and Hardworking young woman. In fact, six months ago I was all over the internet looking for Life Skills Simple Life for a character I am writing about and instantly it recommended me to  Liziqi
 and  XiaoXis Culinary Idyll. I follow both of them and thanks to their vast knowledge I have more understanding about Chinese tradition among other life skills. I have found myself now growing my own veggie garden small apartment, I am trying out Shu embroidery, and building my own furniture FB Marketplace old items to reusable and decorating my place. Yea I dont have bamboo in my backyard but I make them as I go, and all this thanks to Liziqi and XiaoXi    
My brain now ive learnt i want itMy hands no you dont.
This girl just took Minecraft to a whole other level,Meanwhile im struggling to put up my IKEA furniture up
My brain ill go early to sleep tonightMe at am building sophisticated old furniture from bamboo
i wish i was just as talented as her, shes so amaaazing omg
i would rest for probably a year or so, after carrying that much weight on my shoulder all the way through the woods.I ADORE HER SO MUCH GOOD GOD
I think we just found the perfect match for Primitive Technologies guy
Shes so gorgeous, yet super skilled She made me question my life. Im a nerd   behind a computer, so this is a new world to me haha
She can make furniture, clothes, food, and stay beautiful. Forget Super Woman she should be what girls aspire to be like. Amazing, shes just amazing.
Awww Shes so hard working and loving to her grandma 
 its so satisfying how she measured the gap so accurately that when it folds around the bamboo it stands at . What an intelligent woman
Im so jealous of her long beautiful hair
 Do you know why shes touching her head She is rubbing her hair with the needle, so the needle gets lubricated by hair oil. Very traditional way of doing it Ive seen my mother doing this way when I was very young
Me takes an axe with me to cut the trees Liquizi takes an litchen knife

Talented and beautiful woman. I found happiness just watching this.

She makes me wanna be...productive

Nxi ji gi nn de rn, jing fichng goxng, w xingxn. Shngd zh nn chnggng h jindn. W liz bx
        
She doesnt have time to gossip, to complain, to sue people, watch tv, compare herself to others, to envy or have jealousy, looking at social media, she is just the best role model for women everywhere.  I love the way she loves her grandma.
I think that Liziqi never gave heart to anyone...
Is it just me thinking how nice the colour grading in the video is Okay.
This is officially a therapy for me. Seeing a multi talented young woman like you fills me of joy. Good job 
Each of those bamboos are heavy. The natives here in Philippines cant even carry  at once. This woman is immortal
This lady is my hero, she makes so many amazing things I never thought possible even as a craftsperson myself
Watching this makes me think What am I doing with my life
Respect 
Do u find Snakes while doing this
Aww.. my heart. How could she be sooo amazing How did she master all those skills Watching her videos makes me feel like I havent done anything great in my life.. shes so full of life.. like the place that shes living Beautiful...amazing..mesmerizing

Lessons from Liziqi . Focus no distractions. Determination following through till the end however long it takes. Working closely and in line with nature.. Being occupied.. Learning new skills.Result mental peace no anxietydepression and a joyful life.Thank you for your contribution to humanity .
I wouldnt be surprised if one day she built a nuclear power station

Made me realise shes living like those people in historical chinese dramas. Wow
Camera quality so strong could film a movie with dat
Ok. Can somebody please invite her to come visit America Let me know and I will drop everything to come meet her.Ill even chip in for her plane fare.
She is making furniture the traditional way. I am glad I had a chance to watch her video, its a fast food age and people forgotten the true beauty our ancestors left behind
       
i cant properly put together an ikea furniture with a manual this woman is a goddess
I love u
K dislikes from ikea employees all over the world.
Bamboo is very strong yet looks easy to cut and carve. Now I want all my furniture to be from bamboo. I thought my DIY were nice. Hers is amazing.
The knowledge of knowing the characteristics of the wood and creativity is just astonishing.
I really dont understand why people would dislike this 
yeah hi, police Id like to call in a complaint about my neighbor. yeah shes outside at am making beautiful furniture, and its ruining my ability to live in denial about my useless existence
Just assuming we have all been gathered together randomly by YouTubes random algorithm Lets take a second to praise the lord above 
SO  PRETTY AND SWEET
So she makes an entire living room set for her home. Meanwhile, I cant be bothered to throw the single load of wash I did today into the dryer..
The people who disliked this video are just jealous
Having people overWe dont hav enough chairs. This girl wait. Hold up
If theres ever a zombie apocalypse I know where I would go. Great content BTW 
Good job God bless you.......OMG......
Moral of the story Get yourself a girl who can make a bench

I love the little haha when she stood on the homemade couch.This is amazing,  I cant even make a grilled cheese sandwich
I live in Japan, howeverI can rarely see such a beautiful environment.Why Both countries locatein same Asia.Anyway, I wanna live such abeautiful place
She is no actress. She handled bamboo like expert which takes years to mater. I know because when I was younger I made kites using bamboo 
This is soo calming and soothing . Its like getting stressfree . God this girl is super talented
More than talented and creative, I really have enjoyed watching her handcrafte and handling bamboo, and finally the outcome is amazing  ...
After watching several of her videos, I am very much convinced that there is nothing this woman cant do
Nhn e nh th nhng sc khe v bin
This woman is so beautiful and powerful and I hope no one ever gives her any trouble ever in her life.
AMAZING,SHE MAKES ME THINK OFF MY MOTHER. SHE USED TO MAKE OUTDOOR BATHROOM AND OUTHOUSE AND SHE EVEN GOT THE WOOD OFF ANOTHER HOUSE THAT SOLD THE WOOD SO SHE COULD REBUILD IT AGAIN AND THAT HOUSE IS STILL USED BY MY SISTER IN SOUTH AMERICA. I AM HOOKED ON IZY VIDEO NOW FOR A FEW DAYS AND I HOPE SHE MAKES A LOT MORE AND I HOPE SHE IS DOING WELL AND GRANDMA. I HAD A GOAT I HAD TO LOOK AFTER AND WE ALWAYS HAD CHICKENS AND DUCKS AND ONES WE HAD A FARM OFF PIGS. MY MUM HAD A PARROT AND ALWAYS HAD DOGS SO NOW I DON,T HAVE MY MUM HERE AND SHE IS IN HEAVEN I THINK ABOUT ALL THAT. THX IZY LOVE U.
The pencil behind the ear must be a universal carpentry thing.
People who disliked this are clearly jealous of her lifestyle.
EXTRAORDNRIO
The forest is her free IKEA store.
How many skills she has She can be a cook, Taylor and she can make a furniture. Plus she seems never get tired and physically strong 
She is so talented, this is how I would like to live
Its a interesting lifestyle she has. She makes stuff from the things she finds, a very Eco friendly way of living. I wouldnt pull it off. Respect.
   
Im stunned that she casually went out, grabbed some bamboo from the forest and then made this 
The K dislikes are insecure they cant do what she can.
Me calling two of them for just chopping the bamboos
When you mastered every ikea product and dont know what to do
Her and her grandma deserve all the happiness and blessings in the world
She is so productive. I feel my whole life was a waste... I wanna be like her. she is simply amazing
I cant even follow an IKEA instructions manual. Hella props to her omg.
All Glory to Jesus Christ, May Jesus bless you.  I love that bgm
And I cant even put together a bookshelf from Ikea.
So basically you live in the Garden of Eden where everything is perfect.. must be nice

Her videos were introduced by my kids Chinese teacher. When my kid showed me this video, I told my kids, nah, do you really believe on that Well,  weeks later, as I became addicted to those videos myself, I believe more and more her talent and strength. I truly appreciate that there are still such pure and peaceful minds out there, to inspire all generations.
  
This is what mothers need to teach their daughters not how to become a princess, Cinderella or Frozen yet be the Proverb  woman.

My inspiration 
loveed from  me
This lady is what i call Wonder Woman 
Watching this video I saw elegance in her movement as she cut through, bent, and shaped the bamboo is so many ways...but with her elegance there was a sense of strength and hard work put into the making of the furniture. Watching this calmed me and I felt a sense of relax. I love this video, and I love how you made it with only bamboo and other utensils.
What a women so clever and beautiful as well
Omigosh, primitive technology Asia series Thankyou YouTube reccomendations, my new obsession

Bamboo is such a nice building material. Especially for ladders.
I think Bamboo is such a gift from God.  Lightweight, strong, hollow and flexible.  It has a thousand uses.  Amazing plant.
Primitive skills and eco friendly techniques. 
Really amazing 
Okay, now I know what selfsufficient means. This woman is incredible
You have to be the most unhappy and miserable human being on earth to hit thumbs down on a woman making her own furniture from scratch
A Chinese with absolutely zero haters...
Watching this makes me feel like us humans were supposed to live this way.
these videos are honestly the solution to my stress
She is amazing. She is so much talented. I like her most.who like him too
Tere wubf kidnks laidfj

Belo trabalho.

OMG How strong she is..I have personally experienced cutting and lifting these bamboo trees. Although  those trees look thin and light, truely it is not. Those are very heavy, strong and cannot control due to its easticity.. I was really surprised by seeing she is lifting  or  full bamboo trees.. OMG.... it might be the power of her healthy foods.GOOD LUCK

When I was  years old I used to see the mason workers used to work in our hone for various reasons. From there, as a hobby, I start to do creative carpentary. But, Li is really extra ordinary who just used Bamboo ingredients to build bamboo furnitures. Thank you Li, to teach us more traditional carpentery.
I remember my childhood to her pitching water using bamboo,caring woods in your back or shoulder.. i wish i watch this since then because its very educational and realistic ..thank you i wanna do everything i watched when i go back to my country and share my knowledge with my beloved husband because he is a farmer and i learned a lot from him too..keep safe and long life to your grandma..
Wonderful girlAlmost professional in her activities
I think there are more non chinese people than chinese people watching her videos.
i am watching this epesode several times, love it so much

I dont even know how I got here, but I love this
Not only she is pretty but the stuff she makes are pretty aswell Hatsoff to this lady 
She be out here making a while ass livingroom set with her bare hands and some of yall cant put an end table together without instructions
Sexist woodwork is a mans jobThis woman observeEdit Sry i thought bamboo some sort of wood because of how strong it is, also thankies for the likes 
  
I dont know why I watch stuff like this, I guess because its peaceful to me, and it brings peace to mind.  The music, her  Surroundings. The flowers, and the work she put into The furniture.  is  Relaxing
What its actually like crafting bamboo DIYs in Animal Crossing lol
I can hear Jackie Chans voice sayingChinese bamboo dont break
Her grandma must be very proud of herThis is what the real definition of people is.
Dont know why his got recommended to me but Im glad it did. Video is filmed beautifully and I think Ive fallen in love with the lady in the video.
how many skills do u haveliziqi  yes
All that education and degrees cant match level of skills she have
WOW and here I am complaining about putting together some furniture from Ikea smh.
When your waifu power is at max level
There is a saying poverty limits peoples imagination. After watching Li Ziqis video, I think laziness also limits peoples imagination. I never imagined a young beautiful girl could do so much by herself ....
I saw an interview with her where she mentioned that her grandfather made furniture and taught her all about it when she was younger. Its wonderful to see that she keeps the tradition.
RESPECT  Also I think its literally the first time in ages YouTube recommended something Actually good to me.
She should come together with al these people who make the underground pools with sticks and build and entire country
Chinese IKEA proverb Use machete instead of Allen key.
Very strong girl, those bamboos weigh a lot
She makes me feel proud of being a woman. Her skills impress me always. A true diamond.  
I never seen a strong, beautiful and creative woman like her Shes amazing Edit  likes ThanksEdit  likesArigatgozaimashita

Wow She is cute,pretty,strong and self dependent woman. And She is a real example of beauty with brain...
Wth everything around that place feels so magical
This is one of the most comfy videos I have ever seen.
this is people that live to the s years , healthy calm life
I love the granny. Shes cute. Reminds me of my grandma who passed away in Feb of . Grandma, youre always in my heart.
she deserves more fame than all the celebrities and instagrammers chasing after it.
Bamboo is heavy AF..She looks skinny but pretty sure shes actually muscular
I am a Hawaiian born Japanese woman who practices traditional Chinese medicine and you have once again made me fall in love with Chinese culture  I didnt know mugwort could be used as a filler for cushions  I wonder how it must smell.  I also loved the technique you used to bend bamboo.  It looks beautiful in its green state, but Im guessing it will age into a nice beige color.  It totally looked as if you had done this before.  Your tools were so specific and your movements were so deliberate and efficient
Every move she makes is dripping in confidenceAt first I was jealous because of all the cool things she can do and build and all the knowledge she must possess but I realize its her confidence and sureness I wish I hadShes amazing
Being a women I am very much inspired by her dedication hard work calmness  and simplicity........she is a great inspiration to people all over  world especially to the women....
In this cruel world, I didnt knew that such peaceful life exists.
........... 
Hard working woman and clearly extremely smart beautiful

I love to watch you at work, youre amazing, and so creative, artistic, intelligent and a strong person for doing all that you do daily and still so calm, and taking care of your Grandma, also making sure you prepare meals for her too .  I find that I can be able to not stress and relax, reminds me of my country life...which I left  years ago., but all the more interesting to see how much you can do.
How can you do all this things so perfectly .. Really impressed 
Next thing you know she gonna make a rocket from stuff she can find in the backyard and go to space in it 
Parabns , aja pacincia pra fazer o que vc faz ... Muito bonito

CongratulationThis video get ,, thumbs up I am waiting for the day long time .Finally coming.No other person can reach this goal.,,
Having friends from other cultures makes me more creative. In fresh ways about space and how people create their own world and environment. It is best way to connect between creative thinking and crosscultural relationships
       ,  

I cant even make my bed right LOLI gotta step up my game  shes incredible
 .     
Im the only one who thinks ithahawas very cute
im thinking of making  a bed frame with bamboo. i wanna make the way you make it. without machinery. all by hand. if only everyone could live like this, having to make everything on your own. instead of going to the grocery store for veggies for example you grow them. it the work that makes it rewarding and understanding what life was like back then  before us. im so proud of you, it so hard i know, but it amazing seeing what goes on to give your family comfort, food, clothes, but more importantly doing this because you want to. remember, only do what you feel is happy for yourself and insure you can eat, drink, rest especially, but also have time for yourself.  Make sure you care for yourself, do not over do it, it will affect your health.
she is the most talented person i have ever watched on this platform. 
I like how feminine and strong and disciplined she is gin d
No tengo ni la mas palida idea, de que fue lo que dijo en el titulo v
Amazing wow

Drop a like if this is the type of beauty you will want to marry
Never in my life Im jealous this much of someones life
I dont know how to say it in chinese.. but what you make, the way you make all the things are awsome .. you are an amazing person  thanks for sharing all this peace and beauity with the world
Thank you for sharing your expert skills and beautiful furniture.
I wonder how many cuts shes suffered through her lifetime to reach such level of patience and artistry
  
OK this lady has some serious skills up her sleeve, many generations of knowledge and hard labour passed down through family to end up with this beautiful garden of eden,I hope she has children to pass this priceless knowledge to next generation.
Me Watching her cleverly cut and bend bamboo... Well, would you look at that I think I said it thirteen times throughout this video. She held the bamboo steady with her foot while cutting. I would have managed to slice off my own leg while simultaneously cutting the wrong spot on the bamboo.
Give this lady some rocket fuel and shell be the first woman to land on the moon.
Lowkey ASMR EditYes
I dont even deserve to marry one like her shes way out of my league
This feels like if HBO did a mini movie. Very well done
Shooting and editing is very powerful

Next video How to build a space rocket with bamboo and a knife
wife honey, i like a new set of furniture from IKEA.  husband watch this video.
She is really something. Amazing skills.
IKEA makes complicated Furniturethe Chinese Girl imma end this Companys Career
ok what CANT this lady do  legend
I am so glad I stopped to watch this.  Makers are truly the same all over the world their imagination, perseverance and craftsmanship is so satisfying to watch and the filmmaking and storytelling is also superb.  Bamboo looks like such an amazing material  I wish I had a forest to gather my materials from.  The only place I could ever find it when I was young was behind the carpet stores the carpet was rolled on bamboo.  Today they just use paper or plastic or metal  I dont know where one would find large bamboo in America for a project like this.  I did not know it could be heatbent  something new I learned from this video.  And my many thanks for the kind soul who provided the translation.  I will surely smile every time I remember this video.
I wanna live that kind of life
Me at  am gotta sleep, exam at  am tomorrow...Brain  yo dude how about we learned how to make bamboo sofa instead...
WE KNOW SHE DONT LIVE ALONE IN A ISOLATE PLACE  WITH HER GRAND MOTHER... THIS IS ALL MADE FOR YOUTUBE
Chinese civilization is great, and the Chinese people have preserved their ancient heritage over time, a people that deserves all respect
her grandmother must be so proud
that little aha when she walked on top of the bench  so cute 
This is proof that EVERYTHING in this world comes from Mother Nature.

Next season of SurvivorTeam Gonnalose Ok guys, weve made these makeshift tents, lets get started on a campfire.Team Liziqi Ive made a  story hotel with working plumbing,  threadcount embroidered sheets in every room and a star gourmet restaurant just off the lobby, where I am the head Master Chef and sole proprietor.Team Gonnalose .... butTeam Liziqi And yes, there is a complimentary continental breakfast tomorrow.Team Gonnalose Were... gonna lose.
Who needs IKEA when you have a whole bamboo forest in your back yard, and can get matching furniture.
Damn, Youtube recommendations are getting hella good recently.Really serene and puts the mind at peace. Truly awesome.
  .....
Whos still watching this wonderful set in  
Some people still dont know who she is. They said she is paid actress.. come on guys.. look at her hand.. thats worker hands, not an actress hand.. 
If I am in wasteland, I will call all of us, grab her, and let her be our female leader. She will lead us to rebuild human civilization.

I need a woman like that she is very very special
I cant believe she did this without wearing gloves. The splinters
......
Damn, not only did she make her own furniture, but she also embroidered her pillows and sheets. And here I have a hard time understanding the instructions for an Ikea product.
Damn This girl can do everything  is she a human hahaha.
What cant this young lady do The Chinese culture is so beautiful.
Its mesmerizing to watch her confident skill, knowledge of materials, industriousness, artistic sensibility, versatility  imagination.She sets the high standard for being a person of substance  virtue. We can all learn a great deal from her by the pleasure she derives from simplicity  the fruits of her own labors.I, for one, am rethinking my own value system.
Grandma I like the chair on my neighbors house.Liziqi say no more
Strong independent woman without feminist personality.Waifu material at its best
Beautiful, skilled, strong, and compassionate... Whats not to like.
, people disliked this. Excuse me, what Its literally a person making a sofa out of bamboo.
   .
Ziqi i could really use a nice sofa set for relaxing and tea timeproceeds to make a furniture set
    
I was very surprised when she heated up the bamboo and it bends around the pole  whoaaaaaDidnt know you can do that

I just love watching this lady . Her warm heart, knowledge and skills. Top marks from me.

I love this, Its a great thing to see the culture 
U r soo much talentedthats really crazy that u know that much of a lot of different artshats off to u miss


Imagine being beautiful and can build primatively
    
My God  .... Suddenly this video popped up in my suggestions and youre truly a God gifted Artist ... Such dedication , patience and love towards your work is beyond explanation... I wish to see all other videos of your channel one by one ... keep uploading wonderful videos. 
idk why this reminded me of The Tale of Princess Kaguya 
            ,       
Lovely. Bamboo is such a versatile material. She makes this look easy and the results are so elegant.

Is the first time that see this video and think that you is a person amazing, congratulations from Per whit all my heart 
Bravo c est vraiment beau  Sophie France
 ,        ,    , .
A tight slap to those girls who says that dancing and doing makeup all day is feminism..
Fak, she puts me and most ppl I know to shame by her skills... This is a wife to get, if we are having some kind of apocalypse, survival is highly likely with her 
   .  ,  .  , ,  .
Sometimes when you see her hands from a close up looks like mens hands. I think that it looks like a production. Who filmed her Who edit She has different social media platforms, so is this real Does she really do her make up
She can literally make a whole living and Im here starting off and accidentally getting scratches and cry in pain
I saw it and l loved it
Imagine being her neighbor and hearing the sounds of slashing at night and sharpening a knife.
Malayalees undo
She looks like a freaking princess. A hardworking one. Wow.
I almost cry. I remember that my family had a bamboo sofa just like the one that Li Ziqi made when I was a kid. I loved it very much and it was so cool and refreshing to sleep on. With the development of technology and economy in China, we did not need it anymore since weve had air conditioners and fans everywhere, so one day when it was  years ago or so my granny decided to throw it away. I cried and begged her not to do that. She asked meHow would you deal with this big thing It takes up too much space. I didnt know how to answer her. She threw it away two days later... I will always remember the bamboo sofa that accompanied my family for decades, and all the precious things disappeared in the modern society.
And heres my sister, who doesnt know how to fold bedsheet
Bamboo, is one of four plant treasures in chinese cultural traditions. It is strong , bend with the wind and does not break easily. It stays green in all four seasons. It has endless uses and applications in chinese daily life. What this girl did with bamboo is the embodiment of its treasury in chinese culture.

Now I understood why almost all things we used daily are made in China
Youre a genius.
God give you and your grandmother a long life.

The video is perfect in everyway. How the video is shot not only capturing her talent but also the beautiful nature surrounding her. The background music is soo relaxing along with the sound of tool its almost like an ASMR video 
Seriously I could just watch her all day, skilled and beautiful.
This amazing woman is very proud of her culture and  traditions she is amazing
I love how she did not use metal nails in the furniture.
Im about to turn . And I finally figured out, I want to be just like her.
Granny do you think this nuclear power station I built is good Wah, so nice Hehe
For those who question her, Ziqi was abandoned by her parents when she was born. She was adopted by a women but was not well treated. Her grandparents finally took care of her however they are old. Ziqi grew up alone and left home when she was . She did many jobs to survive and learned so many things she was even a DJ at some time. Life is tough for her but she never gave up. However her grandmother was seriously sick so she decided to go back home and took care of her. Luckily, her record of her life made her famous and gave her a better life. What a tough girl
i see beautiful woman make furniture out of bamboo, i click, and immediately press like button, and subscribe.i dont know but i like something out of bamboo. and it is nice to see this video on recommendation
 THOUSAND dislikes Why
This actually living Minecraft.
Its so beautiful. Im too lazy to even do my dishes, but youre making your own furniture
She is so talented, disciplined, strong, and beautiful
After doin all the hardwork she looks so calm,I sense the feeling of satisfaction....I mean ,how can she be so strong and extremely talented in everything she doesUNBELIEVABLE THIS GIRL,just unbelievable.......I wonder how....
Her hometown in Sichuan, which is also the hometown for pandas. lol
Not many people can appreciate living like this.i was born in a.rain Forest, this is how we made our beds
Wow... She just made a set of beautiful furniture in no time and in very skillful manner. I would have probably already died on the way to the forest to get the bamboo, mauled by a pissed off panda or something.
Im scared of the dark when I sleep.. but when I watch her on my bed in the dark.. I feel safe for some reason
First time I feel like, didnt waste  minutes in YouTube. Nice work...
She is so beautiful as well as all her magnificent works .... 
　
Most amazing DIY furniture in the world by the most amazing woman. Salute to her for doing everything from scratch.
She should have married with that guy who build everything with pool. 
Ive been watching your vids quite some time right now and girl... Youre so calming and you carried those bamboos and Im like ohh, of course she does that. And this life is exactly what I wish for. So peaceful.. Like I can sense positive energy from you to where I am now. Like DIYs with nature, this connection of mind and soul thing is soooo calming. Thanks for this vid
Looks like Heaven is smiling on you, and you have the blessings of the ancestors. I am in awe.
The longer I stay in the city the more I want to go out and live a life like this
OMG she can do everything maybe even the world ends, she will survive on her own.

w
 she sounds pleased that the frame is steady. Its so easy to forget shes not always a master of everything but shes also constantly learning. Very inspirational.


Shes so beautiful..And my type of a perfect women..If shes taking good care of that furniture shes making imagine how shes Gonna take care of you happy life..true..And making amazing things..Because some lets say beautiful girls but so stupid dont know anything only shopping brushing there hair wasting time..
She was taught and she learned how to do things on her own, if this was a man no one will be wondering if he made all of that.My comment is made based on the backlash she has received over and over again

The bamboo clonking together sounds so soothing XD
 
Ok what school did she go to That probs has ALOT classes and she did most of them. I cant do crap for life
This is the first ZiQi video I ever have seen, recommended by youtube out of nowhere. I was mesmerized. My grandpas ancient house had the same sofa.

Woah youre really so talented,  I envy you. I dont understand why those dislikes like really, is it for living her life unbothered and so peaceful, definitely its out of jealousy right, shitty people. You keep on what youre doing like always. Sending much much love.

This girl does not need IKEA. IKEA needs her.
Amazing talented work that should be continually passed down to future generations, so that the beauty and skills of this art are NEVER lost with time. That was a lot of hard work, but truly a stunning outcome.
The beauty inside her flows into everything she does.
SpeechlessNo words can describe you liziqiWish you a happy long life
Im not certain as to why this popped up on my recommend, however I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.
She looks beautiful assembling a piece of furniture that she completely sourced from the forest.  Meanwhile I look like crap assembling premade furniture from Ikea.
I was planning on being productive today.  YouTube recommendations had other plans...
I am in love with this woman. All respect

I finally understand why traditional Chinese girls are so attractive.
All the thumbs down votes must have very sad lifes.
This is an insanely beautiful video I didnt know bamboo was so good to work with...
Shes beautiful and does work with pride. Need more people like that.
Im alway waiting for her videos like a kid waiting for a candy  
Man, Whoever marrying her is the luckiest guy in the world.
Little woman but shes strong  can do everything 
May the God bless her mightily and fulfill all her needs
Her knows how to make furniture out of bamboo.Me can barely make my bed.
The fact that you can do all these things and make it look effortless with grace is beyond me. Youre amazing 
I clicked because the girl in the thumbnail looked so pretty and familiar to me. Idk her, but she is so impressive. Strong and beautiful woman.

ancient Chinese people almostly didnt trade because like this way they could make things themselvessuch an example
Bamboo is amazing. Lets utilize it in every way that we can.
Im so glad youtube recommended me this girl 
Lei  molto brava signorina
Im sure she knows KungFu .. I just know it
I dont get why there are disliking.... I mean I cant even carry one bamboo , and I bet the people who dislike it cant either .
beauty, talent, courage,hardworking women everything that a man could imagine of is in her
That is one smart, tough, wonderful, and beautiful young lady.  I gave up my mancard to her a long time ago, when I watched her make an awesome outdoor swingloungelove seatbed.   Those are some really nice furniture pieces I want to take a nap on the lounge so bad...   Thank you, , so much for your wonderful videos. Best wishes.
There are no words to express my feelings right now. She is a superhuman.
Awesome Work
A ideal granddaughter that everyone wish to have.
She is very strong and beautiful
Wow so beautiful and creative. She has a little slice of heaven there. Great work and thank u for sharing ur gift with the world. How amazing would it be to be there for a couple days to relax and get back in touch with what it means to truly be human.

Leadora, carpintera, modista... Hay algo quw esta mujer no pueda hacer Excelente trabajo
Me  gustan tus vdeos. 
This whole video is just beautiful and so satisfying
...... .

For English speakers the title says To add some fresh greenness to life ,making an bamboo sofa.


She inspired me to shoot a video of my mother ..Love From vietnamese.
Shes out here having entire sentence convos with her viewers IN THE VIDEO TITLE
Im pretty sure shes a Disney Princess
Me struggles with putting together an Ikea furniture.Ziqi grows her own cotton to make her grandmother a mattress.She wins at life.
wtf she made a mattress this woman can do literally everything
the fact that she has almost M subs and she doesnt start her vids with whAts uP guYS SmAsh thAt LiKE BuTtOn
she is not a talker, she is a doer ....  her video should be put in the formal education systems too
SHE MADE A FRICKIN PILLOW FOR THE DOG, THIS WOMAN IS A GODDESS
The old traditional tools she uses for making mattress from cottons are very rare nowadays in China, but they werequite common in old rural China households. I dont think you can find any of those tools in other countries.
Your life style is just like a poem and a beautiful song.
Lets sign a petition to Disney to make a princess character inspired from her who doesnt need a prince charming for her survival. This will be a massive hit
The life of is a great way to begin the title your videos
What she does, its extremly important to this world, and its one of the things thats makes internet and youtube worth.

WOW  you have just put most men in the West to shame  Including myself. Blimey. Well done 
Dude marry me Ill provide for youHer with what
That red coat her grandma is wearing looks So comfy and warm, like youre wearing a quilt No doubt she made it for her grandma.
She is incredible. Shes an inspiration to all of us

Is there anything she cant do. Her talent is on another level.

. Li will be back soon.newly edited this comment on Mar.  she said on her WECHAT,Chinas facebook,that she will update new video  today   updates on youtude may be a day or two latter than in China For more info just check out my reply at the bottom  of this comment

Me struggles with putting together an Ikea furniture.Ziqi grows her own cotton to make her grandmother a mattress.She wins at life.
She is so patient   Its make me have more strive in life Thank for updating the video
           
Me after  mins of this video I wanna go live with her and do all these thingsMe at the end of video realises Im a lazy ass
Shes the Duvet Cover Queen, a lot of love went into the making of that Duvet Blanket, Grandmother taught her well
watching her do all those things makes me feel like a useless and lazy human being.
i simply adore these videos of this wonderful women doing all the tasks as she would have  years ago the food and building basic structure is so awesome much Ahroha LOVE From NEW ZEALAND
She always thinks about others before her even if it is a animal.
This life is more beautiful than standing at the phone all day and having no friends
Can you imagine how long this  minutes vid take her to film damn impressed
Incredible how she does everything with love.  She has a good heart.  Increble como hace todo con amor.  Ella tiene buen corazn.
I died at the part where the dog cuddled into the blanket she made for them it was so cute 
I want to go there with your place so I can learn even how to plant and live with my own sweat just like you always shown in your video.
  ,     
Anybody else get tearyeyed when she gave her dog a doggy bed I love her so much. She doesnt know me but I love her and I wish many good fortunes to follow and bless her and her family.
She knows a lot about chinese and she is also very beautiful she create videos about her making things and thats really great. She makes clothes, foods and more for the grandparents.
I actually have a cotton stuffed blanket that is made that exact same way. When you take it out of its casing you can see all the crisscrossing threads. Its super warm and somehow still breathable. My parents and I brought it with us when we immigrated to Canada  years ago and its served me well for many, many winters across multiple provinces.
        
How is it possible to dislike someone who is working so hard  Its such a peaceful life shes living.
     .
    
,   ,     ,     .      . 
Well now I feel like the laziest person on earth.
I love to see grandma she looks so proud of her grand daughter. So much love and kindness in her eyes.
 
Her plants seeds.Me wowHer replants seeds.Me wowHercut seedsM wowHpicks cottonM wowH makes cotton flower arrangement M wowHer makes cotton mattress pad with bamboo and string.M
     
What a wonderful woman I never seen in this world. Shes busy every minute
Giving the dog a blanket was the loveliest part. My heart melted.
What a cute dog. The original way of life feels beautiful.
I wonder how often does she make a mattress I mean, for her to remember the delicate details, its amazing. I do the same things daily n still manage to forget this n that
Im amazed...I honestly have no words.
I think some people might think, Why is she spending so much time doing that, when she can just buy it The point is sometimes making something yourself and living a simple life with the feeling of having all the time in the world is actually a luxury. Its like doing a puzzle or meditating, except you get to enjoy the end result. 

How does she stay so clean Whenever I work in the garden I look like an actual pig.
She has a good land. She is so hard working. She can do all these magical things like a disney princess.God bless her
watching her do all those things makes me feel like a useless and lazy human being.
What a calm loving show and goddesses. Education of Gaia growth abilities.
Soubhanallah from a cotton to a blanket. Imagine if everyone do this in his garden, we can reduce the pollution of their factories. Please, we can all change the world, as a  teenager, last year I planted some beans, tomatoes, but they died, but the avocado and the pine tree are growing, I hope inchallah our garden will be the best. And why Because the climate changing motivated me.Hope peoples will change 
I just love how she has such a large overview of time, to be able to film things weeks, months and, sometimes, years ahead just so she can put them togther at the end.Makes me wonder what marvels she has in her video vault just waiting for the right time to finish and share with us lucky folk.
Estou encantada com os vdeos. So muito inspiradores. Vejo a Glria do Senhor em cada planta, s sementes germinando....coisa linda. Parabns
This is incredible  What an amazing way of living. Beautiful skill.
Li Ziqi grows cotton, mends cotton tools, makes bedding so Grandma can rest comfortably. Even the pup gets a bed. So talented, so nice 
Beautifully created and with such generosity too xx sending hugs and much love across the water to you 
It didnt hit me until I saw her lay the cotton mattress on her grandmothers bed, she worked so hard for so many hours so many days into the night tirelessly weaving and sewing to make a cozy warm mattress for her grandmother and it brought me to tears how selfless and hardworking she really is and how I wish I could be like that
I love your videos, and its very comfortable to watch them, youre very strong and peaceful, thanks for showing and share with us.
The fact she took the time to also make one for the pupper... she gets an instant get into heaven card. What a classy lady. This is what I call class. Not dolled up, not trying hard to be something shes not, providing, caring. Beautiful inside and out. Class act.

Americans the Chinese eat cats and dogs They hate animalsLi Zi Qi makes a cotton bed from raw materials for her pup so he wouldnt be cold
    .   ,     .
I still have this childhood memory of my mom taking our cotton beddings to the craftsmans workshop and let them add more layers. I can still visualize their movements of doing it.  Thats how we survived the humid and severe winter with no heat in central China. Now my hometown is urbanized so fast and those workshops are nowhere to see, our beddings have come from these old schooled cotton to modern mattress. Thank you Liziqi for her beautiful skills to reperform traditional agricultural life style. Its a memory we Asians, as well as humans share together. Its a history we shall respect and not being oblivious of.
Im from chengdu, China.Liziqi and I are km apart, we are both the same age, the content in her video is all the real things that we can get in touch with when we were young, but it takes too much time to make. In China, most people born in the s have such experience, and she reminds me all the time how incompetent I amHa ha haYou are the pride of sichuan and China

Please dont change the name of the series I love it
This channel is the best accident that ever happened to me.
one of the reallife Mulan in this world...
Translation from Liziqis comments
Its OneLife series again. It means a long time spanStarted at about April th, .






 




When I was a child, I often saw cotton growing in the field near my house. But I dont see it when I grew up.At that time, there was a big drying dam beside the house, and there was a nearly   cotton field beside the drying dam.Cotton blossomed beautifully, with white and pink flowers swaying in the wind. I enjoyed flowers in the cotton field, and I felt that Im beautiful too, and I thought I havent changed that till now . 







For memorizing, I planed to grow cotton, and then I bought cotton seeds online.I bought several types of cotton because I was afraid that some of them may not suitable for growing in this climate.Fortunately, cotton blossomed later.But later, I was busy with other things during the transplanting period, which led to the poor growth of cotton. Finally, and fortunately, there is also a little harvest. Not so much...










The picked cotton should be dried to remove water vapor and then be seeded.When I was a child, I saw a special machine for removing cottonseed, but now it is gone, so I could only remove impurities by hand.If you pick one by one by hand, you cant finish it until the Spring Festival. Then I figured out a way to comb the cotton seeds with a wool comb. Its slower than a machina, but its much faster than a manual summary.It took about half a day to finish kg of cotton.









First of all, fix the cotton thread, and then start to strike cotton....... The description of making process, its hard to translate Im sorry...


 
This tool is about  years old, and no one has used it for a long time.The wood is weathered, and the bamboo bars are almost broken.



I spent a lot of time repairing this tool, during which my nose was hurt because of the flying bamboo stick when I cut the bamboo.  Finally, it was polished and could be continued to be used with new tendon strings.



But, remember that the cotton can only be fluff after it is loosened with a stick, because the cotton is too tight to be easily bounced off and will be wrapped on the string. And getting tighter and tighter...










Fluffing cotton is really hard work Its no exaggeration to say that its more difficult to do this than to carry tens of kilograms of grain on my back. When I was a child, I surrounded my uncle every day to see him fluff cotton. But I didnt operate it myself.This time, I wanted to operate it myself. I learned two days in advance, and want to make a quilt for my grandma.Its too hard Because the wood is more than  kg, and I have to hit the string hard, and to keep balance while Im fluffing cotton.By the way, If you can find such a old machina, you can try it yourself.
Although the quilt made by the machine is nice and warm now, I want to make a quilt for my grandma by myself.When she heard that I was going to make her a quilt, she was so happy.
At that time, when I was fluffing cotton, she was always around me and said she wanted to help me hahaha.
I think it was very meaningful


Finally, I made a quilt for Guozainame of the dog, because there was no special quilt before, only an old cotton padded jacket for her.
Now its time to make a new quilt for Guozai.



So...Its very cold these days  I hope you keep warm. And take good care of yourselves Love youtranslated from Liziqis comments in Bilibili

I hope shes okay, with everything going on in China right now. Be safe, we love you
 meraviglioso guardarti.. love from italy
She lost her parents when we was kid and lived with her grandmother till now, lots people was questioning how she manage life looks so easy, here is the answer  she was doing it when she was kid and choose live with grandma now because she is her only loved once, Im Chinese so i have read her background.
Honestly the biggest respecc moment is she has to be like filming her everyday life, most of it, for a long time so you just get a lot of footage sitting around. and then she has to compile and pull together probably hours or footage from over like half a year into one video, and continue to do that consistently for different topics. shit really do add up yo, everyday you dont see progress and its just a bunch of small things but at the end you really do get a bigass harvest. and thats how shes compiling these vids. mad respecc.
Qu Maravilloso video, un ejemplo de dedicacin y trabajo. FELICIDADES A ESA MUJER EJENPLAR 
How nice the little guilt she made for her little dog. I would a new guilt for you as the CNY it is approaching, she said to the dog, and she made one for her. Wish I could be the dog under that nice guilt in her home   Tan Mian Hua Fluffing cotton, is a job in which has been fading out in China. It was a skillful job conducted by the strong  and skillful men. The instruments includes an about m long wooded stick, an about .m long bamboo bend with a  .m depends  string normally made of a refined leather because of elastic and tenacious  and a wooden club. The worker has a belt on his waist and the one side of the stick through on the back.The bamboo bend is hocked on the another side of the stick and the left hand hold the bend with the string down. How to work left hand hold the bend with string move back and forth, up and down to the cotton, meanwhile the right holds the wooden club keeping playing the string. The string jumping like spring upanddown on the cotton of which the way to fluff the cotton from the big mass into a piece of feather.    It mainly operates in the countryside, some people had no piece no land or some of them had poor economy from the land, whatever the reasons. The work literally documents in Yuan dynasty  which means the existence long before that. In the past, the demand of fluffing cotton normally occurred in the later autumn or winter because the farming were done and people became to prepare something for their families, new cloth, shoes and new guilt. That was the season for fluffing cotton to make something. At that moment of planned economy, very few people would be able pay for cash. Many of them paid with grains, a piece of meat, or half fish or some eggs or some sugar....Nowadays, it has totally gone from many Chinese peoples life as we are at the industrialization. Ziqis video gives us a study of common knowledge from a seed of cotton of how the cotton grows up and what does it looks like and the way of cotton have become a guilt. It is an education. It does not warm her granny, her dog and it warms us, the audiences of the world. Thank you very much, Ziqi for sharing with us.  Happy Chinese New Year. All the best for the descriptions it is . million jumping over  billion in the year of Rat 
I like how this is the only place where one nationality or one race isnt screaming at another, pointing fingers and spreading more hate. This channel is full of people with compassion and love, lets keep supporting each other like this and stay safe everyone

Shes very patient and spontaneous. This video must take at least a year to make from seedling to harvesting and sewing.
This was amazing and such hard work Was hoping to see how cotton balls are converted into threads without machine though.
Shes so good Jack of all trade.Love the way she took good care of her dog
You are absolutely amazing, God bless you.
This woman has infinitely more patience, skill, and selflessness than everyone I have ever met combined. She did that all for her grandmother and her dog
I am so proud to see inspiring videos like this.
I swear one of her videos show up on your trending and then the next thing you know youre on a marathon
I pray the coronavirus doesnt touch her or her grandmotherEDIT Calm down, people. I didnt mean to start a war
  
Imagine if school taught us all the things she knew, we would be well off and able to live comfortably.  We would be able to do everything ourselves and wouldnt be damaging the planet much at all
Her hands shows how hard working she is. A truly living goddess away from this digital and hectic world of ours. I hope she can live forever and create more amazing videos like this so the next generations can also see how beautiful life lived in place without fast cars and towering buildings. May God bless her always. .
shes such an inspiration. I was about to cry when I realised she was making this for her grandmother and then for the dog... 
This channel is the best accident that ever happened to me.

My goodness, Li you remind me about  years  ago in Tehran and my grandma was bringing a cotton cover maker at home in very early in the morning till sun down .He was using the same instrument you used to open the cotton balls and then he was swing all over the cover , beautiful motifs in traditional Iranian shapes . Thank you so much for your sweet and educational work . You always bring me back to my childhood . All my family specially my grand children love you and admire you . With love from New York 
I feel so sad your hard work
I almost started to cry when, even after all that hard work for her Grannys bed and she must have been exhausted, Ziqi took the time to make that beautiful little bedcover for her dog
I think her grandma is the luckiest grandma in this whole world ...
Hello Lijiqi... I am from Bangladesh. My wife told me about your video. Yes   Its really feel great to see how you spend your life without technology. Lots of good wishes from Bangladesh

Grandma I think I need a softer bedHer let me grow cotton and see what I can doShe is the definition of self sufficient 
She makes me  wanna live on a far away mountain but then I remember I aint got skills like her lol
Love you lots dear sister liziqiI am an Indian. But you inspired me lots.
How can people dislike this This is pure elegance and life simplicity.
Anyone feels peaceful when watch her videosHer videos can help to take away the stress of life. Love from Singapore 
Her way of starting seed was really interesting.  Shes almost like a historical record of traditional techniques.
Hermoso trabajo, podra verte todo el da. Mi corazn se emociona con la sonrisa de tu abuelita.
Definitely the richest person in youtube. Rich of cultureRich of naturRich of personalityRich of hardworkRich of love
She is Amazing... Take me right to my childhood in Argentina. And I was the happiest person on earth. Nothing better than been connected to mother Gaia and know how to live anywhere. I love her. God bless her for inspires so many peoples.
After watching her videos, suddenly Im doing what I do with more conviction.  If not, its easy to procrastinate and not have the motivation to really do everyday living stuff with a sense of accomplishment.
I hope you guys can have a look at my words.As far as I know, Liziqi has been trying her best to find channels for materials these days. So far, at least , medical masks, , pairs of medical gloves and  protective clothing have been donated by LiziqiShe is too tired, so she has no mood and energy to update the videos. I hope you guys can understand her. Up to now, the coronavirus has been clearly controlled, the number has been declining continuously, and it is expected to be completely solved in March.Pay homage to Liziqi and all the virus fighters
Me need bed go buyLiziqi plant cotton seeds

I love the red sweater with hearts that the granny wears. 
Is there anything this lady cannot make  She is so amazing.  Her grandparents taught her well.
She is the strongest woman that i have ever seen with multi skills from the engineer, landscaper and chef. BIG love from me.
this is the girl we all dreamed to be as a child.
                         
I actually teared up when you made her dog a mini comforter.
VERY TALENTED AND CARING PERSON, NICE VLOG. I ALSO WATCH Mandeepvlogs JalandharHaweli SUPER NICE VLOGS ABOUT PUNJABI CULTURE BY A VERY TALENTED, HARD WORKING AND PLEASANT PERSON
I wish there was a love button. It was so heartwarming when she made the cotton mattress topper for her grandma and then she even made a blanket for the dog 
Looks like her grandpa  when was alive taught her much, respect for her grandpa  n grandma who raised her w love n care ...n she is good granddaughter also.. Btw I love look her cute puppies 
I love her, she is such a hardworking and brave woman that can do almost everything,please support her more especially now since there are lots of bad comments about  her. Also loved how she purposely made the dog a nicer and cozier blanket... So sweet
Omg..the description she didnt had a good harvest but shes grateful to have enought to make mattress for her granny
PLEASE be careful outside, may you and your entire community be safe from the virus
When she made the blanket for the dog 
I cry to see how she love her grandma and her pets 

She is very hard working girl. I am totally impressed. Very good
Thats what I love about China. Wow
I love that she took time to make bed for her dog. That was jus lovely 
She appreciates all the beauty and love surrounding her. Thats why she makes heaven a living reality. And plus, shes so skillful and resourceful, not to mention, also so beautiful. I just admire her so much.
What an amazing woman Why the dislikes There should be zero dislikes for all she does The ending was adorable Love watching all of your videos
this makes me realize how much stress we live under. with school, drama, friends, grades, just go outside for a little and weave yourself a flower crown. breath. the world may do many things to you, but if you can appreciate what the world does best, it will give it to you. all we worry about is the drama, the grades, the work, the pressure, the trying to be best at something thingy, but deep down we dont depend on that to survive. look around, and whenever you feel discouraged or left out, just try something new. breath in and out, in and out. appreciate what the world has given you.
I can only wish to have even just an inch of her skills.
That must have taken  years to make
When she tucked her puppy in, I remembered when I used to tuck my dog in every night and kiss her to bed. But she passed away in April. Ill love her til death. Hugs from Italy 
Dear Li LaoshiWe are all hoping and praying for you and your grandmother and everyone else in China to be safe and healthy in this new year.
ziqi  is okay ,dont worry, because of the virus ,ziqi stop updating, she is working on donation now for the virus ,  as you know , the most important thing in china now is fighting the virus ,  she will update soon ,
Just when you think youve seen everything,  she suprises you with a new talent.  This lady is full of  love and great talents. She deserves all the kindness and love in return  from Canada
I pray that everything will be okay with her and her granny during this darkest time in China. Been waiting for her video but thats okay her and her grannys safety is priority. Lets pray she and her granny is fine.
I wish wed been taught useful stuff like this when we were growing up, in school  instead of having to sit through hours of useless crap, in which we had no interest. With skills like this one is independent, selfreliant.This is why they dont teach it in schools.
She is a very talented and hardworking girl with a big heart in loving and caring for people and animal around her  Alway look forward to her new video
     .    .
One of strongest feelings I have when watching Ziqis videos is this life style can become a therapy for depression. One gets too busy for depression and every outcome becomes rewarding and appreciated. After following her series, I myself became more diligent, and complaining less about daily chores and labor. Thank you Ziqi

She is soooooo crazy Clever girl and the part that it makes her Stand out in my own Opinion is, her love for her grandmother.  This Alone will Lead her to more Blessing in her life ahead. Great gift for a Grandmother. Is a LOVING granddaughter .
Long cu mnh thch xem thank you hi
She is quite famous now. And she always donates a lot of money to schools.
She just made a mattress without using any technology and with her bare hand. I stan.
Im impressed My lazy butt laying in bed breathing hard like I was the one doing all that hard word...
If you want something to be good, make it yourself
Shes not just can do everything, but shes professional in EVERYTHING.

Me I bought this tshirt fabric and hand sewed the entire dress. Liziqi you bought the fabric lol thats cute.
R u okay  We are there for you...We miss you I hope everything is going alright.Stay healthy and stay away from virus crowded areas  .
Noticed her nails that are filled with mud, they may not be the prettiest nails with the greatest nailart but they belong to the most wonderful woman in the world
No one can hate this girl. She has a wonderful talent. And everyone should be grateful about that talent. Even their own talent.
OMG u have so much of patience
She is like that beautiful princess like lady of fairytales who is so loving, strong, golden hearted, hardworking and amazing. I love her so much.
No international  brand can give this pure cotton cloth....
,
omg, her patience with the string. I would be so annoyed after an hour.
Damn. She is the one who should be the actress for Mulan.
Eric Li
OMG...she just stole my heart, taking care of her grandmother and then the way she careful made and put the blanket around the old dog....thank you for sharing 
All the people who disliked this video are the problem with this world. No appreciation for anything. I am thoroughly impressed with her handmaking skills. Very interesting and beautiful.
Omg she made a blanket for the dog because it was cold


I love how that vase is always filled with what she brings inside her home. Flowers in makeup video..and now cotton. It feels symbolic,.....and also gentle. Like time shown in a frame, slowly but surely changing, little by little. Its peaceful...

      
Who wants to watch her videos every day like me

This young lady is fascinating, her skill at some of the ancient ways of living life, making her clothing, making her own furniture, her incredible gardens, and her total devotion to her grandmother.  She is obviously super intelligent, hardworking, caring, and to top it off she is beautiful. Always waiting for her next video.
My cute Youtuber Lizipi...
She does all this work yet still manages to look like a princess.
She kinda reminds me of mulan. Like she is an independent girl who can achieve many things
Me I need a new blanket going to IkeaLizqi hold my machete
The most awsome woman in this crazy world. Take care

Oh..lord how much patience is needed for this.She is a Miracle

This is the most industrious woman Ive ever seen.
The reason why she has long time no updating, is because her grandma is sick, so she needs to take good care of her grandma first. Also, she is recovering and taking a long break, make sure everything fine, hopefully her grandma get well soon and she might be back in few days 
Shed be the only person to survive in the apocalypse
  
     
I feels so useless right now. That is one hell of a woman. Damn
Who r liking to stay in this place
I know, i know, some of you are just too mesmerized by her and not watching what shes doing. For me, I needed to watch the video mulitple times. st time in awe, have never seen anything like this before mouth wide open. nd time, i begin to notice the span of time this project took  the change of seasons, and change in her clothings. rd time, i studied her contraptions, which are worn and needed repair. So i deduced she does not do this project often, or at least not recently. Yet why is she so good at it She works on everything with such confident gusto. I floss my teeth everyday for yrs and have not figured out what length to use. th time, i re watched my favorite parts  grandma, and the puppies th time, i truely appreciated the cinematography of this entire video  always remembering that shes not only the actor, shes the producing and editor. How she anticipates when to zoom in and out, even for the same scene, plus aerial view, and sound mix between ambient and music, and always giving viewers and unexpected sec of heartwarming treats at the end. Science and art beautifully woven. Well done, LZQ Thank you
   

When you cant even make your own bed and she is literally MAKING HER OWN BED...my mother may be ashamed of me XD
I love how she just handed the puppy to the grandmother I dunno I found that so cute 
Isnt great she love grandmother a lot She wants a soft bed and she made for her Hats of this girl She also love her animals a lot She is so telanted Absoulty incridable
Liziqi uploaded a videoMe cancel everything
She is such a responsible girl. I really appreciate her for all the works she hav done. She is great
Liziqi  Just wanted to send my best wishes.  I hope that all of you are safe from the corona virus.  My heart and prayers are with the Chinese people, and all the others suffering from this.  Much love and respect from the USA.
Petition for Liziqi to make a grand tour
I am sure I am not the only one who genuinely wishes that Liziqui was my next door neighbour and best friend. Her caring nature for everyone and everything around her knows no boundaries, and her desire to learn and acquire so many ancient crafts which all too easily could be lost in the modern world is endless. The sheer time and effort which Liziqui goes to when completing all these tasks is beyond astounding. A beautiful young woman with an abundance of talent and a whole encyclopaedia of knowledge. The western world has much to learn from this precious soul.
 that womam is incredibily capable, I want one like she 
I will never look at my cotton quilts the same way again, so much work to make one although mine must be made by machines, Still, it makes me appreciate this daily stuff much more now. Thanks for the education, ZiQi 
Thinking of all the Chinese people at this frightening time. Lizique, Grannie and friends stay safe and well. Love from another Grannie in Scotland

Me scrubbing my face with cotton while watching.Melook at the cotton in my hand each cotton has its own story.
Im extremely impressed by her . Shes the most hard working woman Ive ever seen such a proud
All the dislikes are from people that buy lemon juice in the bottle because they cant even squeeze it themselves.
Love from india 
Now, some people accuse Ziqi,s  videos of being fake and too far away from real life. But think about it. We know for a fact that Star Wars is fake, we know Superman is fake, we know pretty much all movies are fake in that regard. But it doesnt stop us from enjoying a good movie. Li Ziqi is extremely creative. She presents everything with an artistic touch, and the end result is simply amazing. Is it exactly how she lives her life now Maybe not. But even if its a dream, its a beautiful dream built on real life.

She is the kind of girl that can make a home comfortable, and secure.
Liziqi 
Her hand was hurt while making the mattress but she continued weaving for her grandmother. I wish to achieve such high level of dedication.
     
This women is really ausome
I cried at the end when she made a blanket for the puppy.
Me I want a cotton blanket Li ZiQi You need to start planting cotton trees first
She is really a genius. When I was a child I saw professionals touring to towns before every CNY to make quilts like that for families. It is really strength and energy taking as you can see from the video, and Id never seen a woman doing that. Now the skill has disappeared for so many years and she is doing that as a young lady
I love how simple her life is. I feel relaxed watching her videos and it made me realize how toxic office life is. Some of us dreams of living in a luxurious home but her way living is what Ive always wanted
This is a whole new level of make from scratch  lol
Acho que ela come esses cachorros .todo video tem um diferente
Her Grandmothers knowledge is blooming through her.  Sometimes in life you dont achieve your goals but God, Allaah in arabic, helps you achieve them through your offsprings. She is now a global icon.
Creators like her by spending such a length time and puttimg on great effort to make few minutes of video, are making YouTube experience alive. And those puppies gives the extra points to this video. 
goosebumps all over again when I was child Around years ago we used to have such some cotton trees in our field and my grandmother use to do such cotton works but with different toolsmethods.and I remember once I made small kind of tool for her and she used to tell stories about her younger times about  weaving cotton .such a hard work now the technologies has changed a lot in the last decades this make me remember old times my grandmother once againLove From NEPAL tq for your hard work and dedication  li ziqi.
The look on her grandmas face. She must be so proud of her, that she learnt all these traditions and can still do it correctly. Love 
When she cuddles up that puppy and it was so sleepy and cute. Heartmelting
 ,  ...
I pray that she, her grandma, and her pets never get hurt or sick. Theyre sweet.
The nine thousands of people who disliked this video shame on you

   ,    .
  .    .
Mom make your bedMe sigh...Liziqi ok, you mean literally right
Why is nobody talking about those cute dogs
Very much adorable when she makes something for her grandma n Tommy as well with her own hands. The way she puts on doggy is so carefully and love Heart feeling.
  
The best part of this is how shes embraced her roots  culture wholeheartedly and unabashedly. If I could Id go back to Sweden, have a farm, some kids and live quietly and simply. For now Ill do my best to replicate that where I am .
Shes making her grandma a mattress.
After watching this and given the fact I have always enjoyed living at the village, helping out my grandparents, growing our own food and herding the livestock. I am going back soon as I complete my studies
       ,      
I just cant figure out, how could a woman like this is real. Every single one of her video is just so soothing, I start to cry when I realize that Im abroad alone and that I miss my country so much... Thank you Li Ziqi, thank you

She is so genius and a hard worker
Fun fact This handcraft stills runs in Li Ziqis family. Thats why she have all basic ingredients and tools using traditional Chinese techniques.

This is beautiful
We grow tonnes of cotton, but never once tried something cool. This is the difference between me and this girl. May God bless souls like me to make some wonderful things
Shes a legit disney princess, like Mulan... but of agriculture
Dear Ms. Liziqi, are you fine I wish you and your family well. I am very sorry for the people in your country who have suffered from corona virus. I wish triple gems blessed you 
We get to choose one person to represent the human race, Im choosing liziqi
Omg that made me cry when she tucked the pup up and she adores her grandmother. She is a very hardworking lady and I wish her only the best

 Good doggySome of the subtitles are copied from the subtitles translated by other people which hasnt been reviewed, so thanks to themLiziqi speaks Sichuan dialect so I couldnt get everything she said, but this is most of it.Im still working on my English, so if there are any improper translations please dont mind, and it would be nice if you point it out so I can learn.
I would love to live like this. Shes an ancient sprit that came back into the world to teach us the true meaning of life.
Maybe shes the younger version of her grandmother, that is how her grandma raised her
it made me sad seeing her rub her wrist whenever it hurt, shes such a hardworking person.
Everyones binge watching Netflix, and Im over here like, Liziqi and chill...
The best thing about her is how she cares and treating her grandmother  the rest isnt precious as much as that

Big like super good night aap bhi I Hamare ghar welcome
Anyone
Shes the princess I want to be like
She is so talented... I really hope the best for her and I hope she wont catch that horrible Coronavirus spreading around
Inspirasi banget
English Translation of Title Cotton ... Cottons life, I promise to think of a new series name next time hahaha
Who wants her to make a house tour or a farm tourI really love the way she live her life away from the city
I barely do anything yet her hands look better than mine. And I am a teenager...
She and I come from the same place. When I was a child, my neighbor was a shop that made new cotton quilts. A quilt can last for many years and is very warm. My entire childhood was spent watching their magic techniques. They have been doing this for many years. Until today, new technology has taken away the tradition. Few people have made their own cotton into new quilts. The inherited things gradually disappear in the everchanging world. Thank you Ziqi for the touch. She and her lovely grandma remind me of those plain but precious days.
OmgoshThe way she wrapped her dog was so adorable.Shes truly a pure soul and it reflects on everything she does Hats off,lady...The perfectionist of YOUTUBE 
 
Any Indian here I know if any Indian is here like me then it is normal we have seen these all kind of work in real life
Learned information from WEIBO of her assistant that she is OK recently, after some days of busy to collect and delive N mask and other things to hospitals  running out resource in virus battle zone, now she is trying  to make routing life back to normal from work too late in night editing video in last two years, at same time to  take more time taking care grandma, but still work a lot ...,she may return in these days. Thanks.
Im glad that people in this YouTube channel are supporting Liziqi during this virus outbreak in China, after reading hundreds of racism comments towards Chinese virus people on the internet.
From Vit Nam with love
Terus gue apa njirr
Its admirable and while watching, tears started to build up. The part where she fixed it as a bed for her grandma, could no longer hold my tears. And the dog part was like sudden onions thrown my way
Just watching this makes me tired. In a single day she Picked the cotton that she grew herself  which she painstakingly took care of cotton is not an easy plant to growDeseeded it herselfPulled out and fixed...idk what machine that is, but it looks hard as hell to useProceeded to carefully twine the strings around the sticks of the machine all in like a day. Today I got up and was immediately nauseous bc I stoop up too quickly. Truly we are undeserving of such amazing content.
You did a great job , very nice
   , ,  .  ,  .    
 
Dont worry,she lives country side.outbreak in big city.she is more safe than people in London
After watching her channel I admire her hardwork, her willingness to do something until finish, her dedication for doing the all those labor. This also made me realize how great the nature is, for giving us everything we need. Watching her reminding me say thankful to this wonderful modest life, all this time I have been working hard but not to my heart content but for the sake of papers. Wish I can do more of nature labor this year to refresh my mind.
   
It really makes you realise how much cotton it takes to make the clothes and bedding we take for granted every day

Everyone one of u who disliked this video are just jealous because shes smarter and wiser then u Will Ever Be
please add subtitles  
 probably the only best thing I have witnessed on the internet.
To all the people of China my heart and prayers are with you. Be safe, be strong and please make it through this illness.
One way to help her is by not skipping the ads, thats how she earns..the longer ad views the more earnings.
I think about how much she can do and make, and remember Granny was part of teaching her everything she knows and I just get so happy seeing two strong women out here kicking ass on the regular. 
I just cancelled my favourite series movie when I got notification of Liziqi new video 

When liziqi uploads I stop everything and watch it.
make a video of what you cant do
I think I am laziest on the earth
I can tell that shes really skilful when cutting the bamboo, cuz my grandpa used to do that. dont understand those who claim she is acting...
She just made a mattress........a mattress....a whole mattress. Im just useless, I dont even make my bed.
Have no Words to express my feelings for her. Really admire her talent. She can do anything from scratch and does things which brings joy to others.hats off to her
The way she was so gentle with the puppy is preciousShe gave him a new bed without waking him upIncredible, shes like an elf or fairy or something like that with a connection to nature
    
 youtube
           
In a apocalipse scenario, finding her increases my chances of survival by

For those people who dislike this, you guys just bitter and jealous cz you cant live such a happy peaceful life like her. Yall trapped in the city and stressed out with your office work
Why some people come to this channel just for tab unlike. Even they dont finish watching the video. How could it be
 
I cant be the only one who likes her hair, they are so silky
I cant help but admire her hard work ethic. She puts so much thought, love and dedication into her videos. People dont realize how hard and how much work goes into this.. Not only making the videos the but the actual work shes doing. You are AMAZING Liziqi.  keep being the beautiful smart and hard working girl that you are. I can see the love and respect you have for your grandmother. Its truly a rarity these days you are a diamond
Ill never forget the time I said she reminds me of a live action studio ghibli character and then the background music you chose for a video was from Spirited Away Made me love this channel that much more
      
the fact that she didnt wake the dog up is sjjsjsjsjdks
i thought i was missing out in life. after watching this video im now questioning whats life.
The smile of the grandmother is the prettiest
u r inspirational and a beam of light in so mcuh darknessI love ur gmas smiles
       
Such a beautiful woman..... Thank you for sharing your life and for being a blessing to so many.
Didnt this have the ambient sound throughout it at one point I love the music, but there was something especially calming for by about the original sounds.I mean, either way this video is wonderful. Im just curious.
         

,,    
This sound is so satisfying. Feel like flying in sky

Incrivel como essa peca para a cama ficou linda aqui os nossos teares sao diferentes ainda temos alguns manuais mas sao diferentes parabens um abraco desde este lindo Pais que e Portugal
Dear Liziqi, thanks a lot for sharing the simplicity but in the same time the beauty and complexity of the ancient Chinese culture. All around your life is so inspirational. Living out of what God has created, every single detail on that rich culinary food. As a idea for future episodes,  it would be awesome if you shows us the way you built the utensils in your kitchen, such as Bowls, baskets, containers, skimmers, etc. please, please just keto doing what you do, I watch your videos in our living room for hours and its just so relaxing. Thanks and thousand thanks
love her video..so inspiring...at least i am in peace when i watch her video and forget about the stressful daily routine..
Eres muy sorprendente, eres una persona unica, especial y dedicada en cada uno de los trabajos que realizas.Gracias por compartir un pedazo de tu mundo y ensearnos que existen personas sencillas y humildes en este mundo.
I love your videos and feel comfortable when l was it you good girl 
A life style many cultures have lost, to live off what the earth provides. I crave a peaceful life like that, teachings of old ways to cultivate and build with your own hands.

She gives so much love through her hard work.
Amazing 
      
queen

I love like grandmother.
She grew her grandma a whole ass blanket
The fact that she made a mattress for her grandma and also her dog but didnt even think of making something for herself  True selflessness 
God this girl is a great
Hats off to this lady
 

anybody else watching her vids out of sheer escapism..like god what a life ,to own a plot of land and farm and make so many things yourself shes really one of the most wonderful content creators
She is just living a simple and great life with mother nature... She is so luckyyyy
Im Chinese        She said with the little dog I will make a quilt for you before the Chinese New Year too,OKWhat a lovely and kind girl
Vous  est  in   expert  AN  tout bravo  felicitari
i appreciate the amount of time they took to make each scene.. it must have took them hours and days to show us these beautiful scenes  meanwhile all i can do and brag is the amount of time me spending watching youtube or her videos 
mantap abiezz


Even if she didnt to everything, so what, she does more than any woman or man I know, its entertainment at doesnt involve hurting someone or shaming someone or laughing at someone in pain, she is showing her culture and techniques that she has learn, what a woman, so humble
The tremendous amount of hardwork she does....is on a whole different level league and little new members to the family
She makes everything possible...theres nothing else that she cant do
Are you okay, Ziqi I am really worried about the virus that is raging on the earth, especially your country. Hope you and your grandma will be fine. I will always support you. Everyone, please send a word of encouragement to her.
this girls intelligence n the things she can create are far beyond me
She even made the doggo a bed TvT this lady is straight out of a Ghibli Film

Shes a great human.When I was little I wanted to do stuff like this. Make my own furniture, bedding, clothing, etc.I wanted to live in a farm with my own family.Its been  years and I still highly admire work like this. Unfortunately I wouldnt be able to live in a farm because I have a high fear of insects and mosquitoes.
In my grand parents village, This cotton beddings craftmans mostly are menShe must be strong then
When her grandmother came over with that jar of something for her wrist because it was hurt....that was the cutest thing

Living like her could be the key to save earth
Even that dog is luckier than me... First time feeling jealous of a dog
The patiences she have is probably what my mom was lecturing about me needing have. 
In a world having an identity crisis, you, dearest Lady, are the definition of how life should be, diligent, hard working, maintaing the old whilst embracing the new, compassionate, strong, exemplary example to the People of Earth. Beauty, intelligence, humility and fortitude. Bravo, Bravo and Blessings of continued Bountifullness. Love defined and refined. 
For the people who say shes an actress, i hope you changed your mind bc she is a REAL  HARD  WORKER 

Shes so pure she even made a blanket for her dog 
Update from her assistantLiziqi is now busy doing spring planting for her farm. Her grandma has old people minor sickness as usual so she will also take care of that and also cooking and watch a little TV with grandma before going to bed. Liziqi has been having a lot of late nite sleep for pass several years because editing video so she want to take opportunity to rest a bit. Her assistant say they knew about us asking for update so perhaps let her rest another half month.Screenshot httpsm.imgur.comgalleryzMtpvFx
    
Mind blowing and magical Making the little dog blanket and covering him so tenderly without waking him was pure love. Nothing short of perfection. I cant stop watching it.
When we talk of women empowerment. I feel this girl nails it. She is truly in all sense empowered.
Protect yourself because there is a high risk of the Corona virus in China nowadays. Also urge your grandmother and those around you to exercise caution many prayers for you
Me at the beginning Omfg shes making mud pies Oh...wait...nevermind..

  

For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son Jesus Christ, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have Eternal Life.  John 
Im not sure I have ever before seen someone with such a tireless and amazing love language as this woman. Every video that comes out, I am astounded by her hardworking yet tender nature, and captivated by the process itself. I have learned so much from her, and we dont even speak the same language. I love it.
woooowwwww

Ch y  gii qu
Meaning of FROM SCRATCH finally found  understood.
I wasnt expecting that she did all that for her grandmother such a selfless sole . Thats true love 
Me cannot even crochet.Her can make a whole mattress from stuff in her backyard.
I cant imagine how ancient Chinese are good at making this kind of stuff wooow.
 .      
I actually think thats the perfect name for a series 
Some times I should say every time I think hows u knows every thingggg u can do anything wow u are Soo amazing and your place is the beautiful place I ever seen
Wonderful to watch. So much dedication and attention to detail. Feels like a rewarding and peaceful way to live. I love the relationships, too.
The heck that was so amamazing  i cant unsee it my gosh
This was baeutiful, especially when I understoodyou were making a new bedding for your grandmere. And the blanket at the end for your pup made me happy 

The life of cotton is still my favorite among all her videos. I keep coming back every hour just to watch this
And until the last video you uploaded, the title is still The Life of...  But its okay, that makes you remarkable
I feel very peaceful   satisfy when i am  watching your videos your such a incredible  women love you form pakistan

God bless her heart She is an angel So talented, yet so lovingly thoughtful I really admire Qi 
 looks like chocolate pudding.
Such a delite to watch making of that sheet... Everything is sooo unique traditional n amazing
So amazing and outstalnding works we shoud be learn.
By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken for dust you and to dust you will return. Genesis   NIV To live a life like this, wow what a great fulfillment.

You is incredible 
Perfeito 
Her grandma is so precious.

 I hardly take of my hairs out of the brush
  
Thanks for sharing 
 
Great job... She was awesome
Ellerine salk ok gzel emeinize salk ahane yapyorsun hataydan selam olsun
    
This video got copyright I think thats why she replace it with different audio
Inspirational womenhands off to u 
Not everybody have the patience to wait for a plant to bloom and bare fruit to put it on a video, she is really a mesmerizing person.
    
So so youre so so pretty girl
When I saw her picking the cotton one by one, it reminded me of a movie called,  years a slave, in a cotton field, a whole bunch of people were harvesting cotton in that cotton field, Im surprised that it took more than one person to harvest all the cotton, while ziqi does it all by herself, she really is a superhero. It just shows that with time and kindness the same thing can be done with amazing results.
Awww...she made her granny a warm mattress topper and she made a warm blanket for the little dog How sweet is that
If anyone has a desire or wonder why she is the way she is calm, relaxed, peaceful I think you should definitely read Proverb  virtuous wife
    
  ,   

One videos takes more than a year to film cause they have to grow and grow the food and stuff so it must take her so long just to make one video for us
Beautiful girl 

An incredible innovative skills and ideas with fabulous beautiful thats a perfect talent from the human being,so you are one of them... always love and blessings  from INDIA one of the most beautiful country.
    
I wonder if there is anything that she cant do
She is the most skilled person i have ever seen, just mind blowing abilities to do so many things with such a precision its just insane.
this blanket worth millions

Define strong independent womanMe  Liziqi
Lots of Love from japan

She doesnt need money...because she did herself everything what she needs..so proud of miss liziqi
Hi from Australia, I am  years old now and i take  care of my  granddaughters,  I grew up in a home like yours ,that is in the  country..a coastal town that is.My Grandparents  taught me a lot also.Some of the things you do is what i did.After living in the city i found i became ill ,my husband left me with the children so i moved to a country town as i knew how to suvive  I still miss the ocean though. I brought up my children  they have moved to the cities i taught them much ,but I now have my teen age granddaughters with me,  and they want  to learn all i can remember as my hands are not as strong now. You have reminded me much i have  forgotten  thank you,and i do love your  cooking, i always loved cooking in a wok and steeming foods the Asian way instead of unhealthy English foods  ,i made rose pettle cordially though ,my grand children loved it .And one said it cured their tummy ach....natural foods  are better for you though it is hard work.Where i live the climate is harsh..droughts and floods.The ground is poor and you cannot grow anything in it so i grow a few things in large tubs....we get by.I look forward to seeing more of your vidios you remind me of happy days in my grandparents home. Many blessings

That was an incredible video Li it brings back memories of my mother she died in ..and how we do that in Samoa but our cotton wool trees are tall you have to climb up and cut down or shake the brunches so that those dried bods can fall off the brunches and inside there are small seeds as well another hard work taking them off..it brought memories of how lazy I was cause I was young and lazy lol..now Im .. i  dragged my feet ...when my mother said that we gonna make some new billows and mattresses..I hated it.but dont show too much.. ah ah...its a long long process..thanks for bringing back those good old memories with my loving mother and two young sisters thank you Li...you look amazing girl in this video...God bless you and your grandma and family 

Me and my daughter have been thinking about you. We hope that you and your grandmother are well. Were also glad that you have all of these survival skills so that it is hopefully easier to stay home until this threat has passed.
She doesnt speak in front of the camera but what She does can reach to our hearts,
Ziqi    

 According to her blog, she injured her nose during this video production when she was splitting bamboo to fix the mattress set.
Dang, homegirl went into grandmas attic and found the old loom , refurbished it and made her a mattress pad to keep grandma and the doggie warm.
I know Im not the only one who got teary eyes when Liziqi wrapped the puppy in his own wittle blanket. All snuggled in  loved 
Some info about Li Ziqi Li Ziqis grandfather was a cook in her village, many of her cooking, woodwork skills etc. were learned from her grandparents. In the initial stage, she did everything alone by herself because she could not affort hiring people. After she became famous she hired an assistant and a videographer to help her.
Shes a master and restorer of all sorts of arts  crafts we want to preserve. Another stunningly beautiful work Thank you as always.
 

imagine to actually live there, just you and ppl that really care for you, away from toxic people. waking up every morning to that incredible view and go to sleep with beautiful night sky....
She melts my heart when she made one for her doggod bless you

She is so quick, efficient and hardworking.
LiziqiGoogle
Most interesting part of this video was when she makes special blanket for puppy, put on him without disturbing his sleep.

What a kind, beautiful soul.
So beautiful.I really enjoyed while watching this video
Those who lie lazy all day, do not want to do anything. They should watch Liziqis videos . Because there is so much to see and learn from Liziqis video .

She is the best girl in the whole world
Truly, I purposely watch her videos right before I go to sleep,  because it helps me  in such a way, like so peaceful, zen like. It brings such a beautiful free feeling, like therapy. I have enjoyed every video of hers, and look forward to them. The love and care she has for her grandma, it speaks volumes...
Liziqis comment on bilibili,translated by Google translateAnother Lifetime series Gu Yu started shooting before and after. When I was a kid, I often saw cotton growing hereBut never saw it again when I grew up At that time, there was a big sunbath near the house Near the dam there is almost  acre of cotton Beautiful when blooming White pink flowers swaying in the wind I pretend to see flowers in the cotton field, And pretending to be beautiful  It seems that at least I havent changed   I tried to plant it this year.Worried about variety reasons, I bought several varieties Fortunately, there were buds. I was busy with other delays during the transplant period,Resulting in poor final growth. But fortunately, it is a bit rewarding. Remove the cotton to dry And then deseed When I was a kid, I could find a wood comb for cottonseed. But its gone now So I can only rely on my hands Picking one by one is definitely impossible Think of a way Use a wool comb to comb out cottonseeds It is slower than a carding machine, but also much faster than a hand abstraction.  pounds of cotton for more than half a day Cottonseed and impurities are removed and ready to be pulled This is the cotton net Wrap the spun cotton evenly and densely So I want to pull Pull horizontally and vertically to make a grid, After the large warp pulls the small thread, Pull left and right horizontally Finally, the longitude and latitude of the large line must be fixed. Once the thread is pulled, you can play cotton The tools are about  years old Long time no one used Weathered wood, bamboo strips are almost broken Patch up for a while When chopping bamboo sticks, I was stuck in the nose by flying bamboo sticks Sanding and polishing with new beef tendon strings can also be used Remove cotton seed cotton and loosen it with a stick. Cotton is too dead to bounce off easily More and more tight Playing cotton is really hard work This is not an exaggeration, it is more laborious than letting me carry dozens of catties. When I was a kid, I surrounded my uncle every day to watch him play cotton Havent done it in person, This time I was doing batting for my grandma. I learned it two days in advance. Too strenuous  pounds of wood, And the force of the mallet pulling the tendon string On the basis of this force, we must maintain balance and loosen the cotton. Both hands must work hard to maintain harmony If you can find this old object, you can feel it.


Most people have forgotten how to do these things because of manufacturing and capitalism, where jobs are broken down into smaller and smaller components. Nobody remembers how to make everything you need for life anymore.
She also deserves the highest subscribers among the utubers. Why dont we all give out our best thumbs up and also subscribes her channel by sharing with brothers and sisters if she is willing to shear her knowledge with you and me.

When all the hardworking people from ancient civilizations reincarnates into one body

Protect this person at all cost. She is an inspiration. My bad for discovering her channel at this time only. But bingewatching wont hurt anyway.
With the world in this way I think living like her would be perfect and an example to follow
i died when she made that blanket for the dog. someone do the same for me
        

This girl is really too special for this world... An All in One type of human being 
I like this beautiful girl so much, its not only because she could do everything which we think that its impossible to be finish by a person even a woman, but also i could feel the beauty of eastern civilization from her, every scean and each lanslide in video remind me of how chinese culture is attractive. The most important thing is that many of us have lost us into the fast and new thing from western culture instead of pursing chinese traditional culture and spiritful thing. This video is deserved to recommend to our millennials who have obessed with so much thing from other country like Japan cartoon and anime, Korean Kpop. Lets hope that there are increasing this sort of traditional  promoted chinese culture video

She is such a hard working woman.... Hats offAnd who the hell are those k people.....who disliked the video

                   
you are a beautiful hard womam
.k dislikes Why I dont understand why peoples dislike videos like this such of inspiration also the music is so relaxing can someone whos dislikes this video explain to me why you disliked the video if you have ball replay my comment
I admire this lady on a spiritual level. The sheer resilience, diligence and willpower exudes overwhelms me. I love how wholesome and pure her affection towards her grandmother is. To a certain point Im kind of jealous but that jealousy is what makes me strive to be a better person. I wish I could communicate to my grandmother the same way she does and I wish I could be as hardworking as her. The more videos I watch of this lifestyle the more I start to change those I wish to I will, watching how peaceful life seems there fills me with a sense of determination... but Im still procrastinating doing Science revision
I wanted to thank your great country, China, for helping Italy to overcome this drastic period. Thank you.
It brings tears to my eyes how she takes care of her granny.The people that dislike this must be either very misinformed or just made of stone.
Man, I swear, this is how you live a fulfilling life. I know its not for everyone but if I was given land with a house Id never work a  to  job again.
I would risk the Corona virus for her. P.s if your offended by the mention of Corona and dont have it, sit down and eat some soup
The smile on her grandma face when she sat on the bed was priceless. Such a precious granddaughter
oh to be liziqis dog sleeping peacefully wrapped up in one of her home made blankets

My heart melts when she made her granny and her adorable dog a beautiful blankets.. god bless you

She is a real princess Ive ever seen my life
This video is so beautiful.  The cotton process the family love.  Everything was just to positive to watch.

The last part of vedio with dog was so emotional
Very talented , gorgeous ,caring , hardworking and beautiful young lady
The amount of patience she has for making the blanket wow this channel really calmed me
Big fan of that lady such a inspiring womam 
Inspiring video I have ever seen and the way she handled her dog mesmerized me a lot. May God blesses her till the end.... Inshallah

Im telling you shes a princess.

 .  . ,       .           .
She is  amazing.. They enjoying the natures gifts while we are on a meaningless race. But she is so hardworking girl.
She shows love and care
, 
why does she look like mulan Das not a bad thing its meh fav movie  D
 
She is a great soul
  ...
After watching her impressive skills ,even I became her fan
Her making and giving the little puppy a blanket was the most wholesome thing Ive ever seen. 
The fact we all like watching her work hard while were in American laying in bed eating hot Cheetos.

I was wondering if she is ok because we havent heard from her for a while Hope she and her grandma are ok 

Is there no one going to talk about his brother love who is always with her and never came on camera . I read about her on Google and get this information when she completed her study and started working for a company... she left job and came back to her village ...never seen such dedication its amazing to see her videos 
OO
  
Making comforter for her grandmother is  warming. She can afford to buy a new one, but this shows love conquers all. Lucky puppy got one too.

me ur.big friend i am bangladasi
I want a friend and life coach or instructor like her. Im willing to learn manual labor for a year. Blessings to you li. May your work and labor be prosperous.


She is cute 
The instrument shes using is also used in most Arabic countries in the past . The guy who make the cotton quilts is called kattan from the word cotton
 Oooo whats she making with the leftovers A pillow Knee Blanketgives dog new blanket with the gentlest of tucksMe, crying profusely OOH
And theres me who just got their plant from school and has died
  
when she sucked that string through a branch i was officially done


I dont know Chinese. Hope you understand my comment here  You are a very special person who helps inspire more motivation to other people in Vietnam, included me. By your videos from the beginning until now, I understand that mother nature is huge and unlimited and being offering too much for the human. We should live close to our natural environment instead of trying to change it in our ways. Love you from Vietnam. 
this woman has better cinematography skills than  of hollywood
 
    
SHE MADE ABED FOR THE DOG IM SO SOFT RN 
she could replace perfect word with her name on dictionary
I felt my hands hurt as she was picking the cotton, I felt so bad for her.
The love she put into what she made for her grandmother and little dog is absolutely beautiful.  


Her granny must be so proud of her as shes carrying her legacy exact the way her granny used to be 
Someone I bet you cant make...Lizi Hold my beer

Advance Happy Chinese New Year to you, to grandma and to your crew. May you be blessed more, pretty princess 
This woman is clearly an empath. Thats why shes so loved and loving.
she is wonderful,she is nice and know everything about nature
That dog at the end is soo cute 
that dogs name is Guogai, her oven is made of herthat dog shaped oven
Shes the most ASTONISHING WOMAN ever. Give her the credit she deserves.
Her grandma looks so proud. That sweet smile was my everything.
               
such an amazing lady.. hope i can live with you.. to experience that kind q of environment and how to be with your grandma..  keep safe always..
                             
One of the most inspirational amazing videos Ive watched in a long time and the  ladys are so beautiful xx
When the grandma passes I bet she will hand craft the coffin and have a beautiful ceremony
only if I can see my grandma smile just one more time like her grandman does
Your videos are eyecatching. Wow.
What a beautiful life, i cry
  
Such a beautiful video. So I want to be there with this girl.
It is my pleasure to see my translation                 ...........   httpsyoutu.becUZUxswLuNwhttpsyoutu.bevEPkrUZZI
Oh gosh i just watched her videos today and im so addicted to it that since morning Ive been watching all her videos and didnt realize that its evening now.. This girl is so hardworking and talented. God bless you dear.
I want to build house like this type of location..This location look like very beautiful and make my mind peacefully.
Looking at those gourds always reminds me of cultivation manhwas lol
I want to live a life like this sooo nature friendly, and soo freshh

Has the music changed I think there were different sounds in the second part of this video. Like usually  some background music, but you could hear what is going on there too. Now it is just piano.  I have seen this video like  times and I think it was different before.
Does your hand have power  when you planted everything why they are growing surely well
And my friends wonder why i obsess over old material hand woven. I used to have a business selling antique and vintage textiles. Now i am retired and must part with some of my collection. I just see how painstaking doing it before machinery was and a labour of love went into it. Even the fancy monograms for the family initials could be beautifully done. I would love for this  lady to have a farm style bed and breakfast, a working holiday to learn her craft. But i am sure is very busy with her life as it is....... she lives a beautiful life
What lady....she knows everything,ably to do anything..
Hi Li Ziqi. Itsbok to name your series with The Life of..., at least we know what the video will be about. Keep safe, to both you and grandma. 
     
Boys saying girls are weakMe how about now
looks so comfy 
She loves her grandma and her dog a lot, I admire her
 .  
when she picked up the little dog and gave it to her grandparent it gave so many memoriesI remember when I lived in Filipeans and has a family of dogs living at my place, the house was close to the beach and u had to climb down a small cliff to get to the beach but the life there was peacefuleverytime I went on vacation with my family some dogs werent there due to death and there was always new dogs I still remember a dog named Koi was theremost of the dogs bite but Koi seems kinda old and peaceful so she would never bite but she had very low healthI hope the next time I visit Filipeans Koi is there
Im at the scene, Im the tool in Li Ziqis hands, come and envy me
I love her lifestyle 
   
She makes her own food for her and her grandmother thats just sweet she puts hard work in to her food
Wooow such an talented youtuber

Fenomenal girls
Shes zero waste in everything she does, everything has its purpose. 

 look at how defined her hands are. They arent dainty or delicate looking. They are rough and well sculptured from hard work. I cant imagine all the calluses she has from doing this.
In the US I was raised in the South where we grow cotton...and I know how hard work it is...this was a lovely video...thank you
 She wounded her nose while splitting the bamboos, according to her Weibo.
  ... 


This woman is wonderful. In addition to being very talented, she is extremely strong and dedicated.
......
Its pretty cool to watch people do things the way the old world did it. For most of the modern societies this is a forgotten skill.
I wonder where is Liqizi now and how is things going with her Dont you guys Ive been visiting her channel  times this week hoping to see her new video. I hope she is doing well Cant wait to see her new beautiful works
Her grandmother is so lucky to have her. She really love her
I hope shes okay and where she lives is not infected with coronavirus   nCoV.
Ziqi Showing how cotton duvet is made from the cotton seeds manually. Me Moved to tear. Amazing.
And here I am being lazy and complaining about my problems. Shes a true inspiration
The most beautiful, talented woman Ive ever seenShe can make anything out of everything..
      .         .   ,  ,  ,       .
Very difficult technique and requires a lot of patient and hard working but the result is beautiful. Great thing to do for grandma. Love her passion and devotion not mention her look , she is a beautiful young lady, inside and outside

Who needs a boy child  This girl literally single handedly holds that place down.Im not sure if its a politically correct  thing to say, but thats what came to my mind.  So excuse me, if I offended anyone.
uses leftover cotton to make the puppy a blanketeverybody liked that

      
Im convinced she has more than  hours in her day
WHEN DOES SHE SLEEP SHE DOES SO MUCH I CANT
FantasticBrilliant
I live with anxiety and panic disorders. I cant describe how relaxing this girls videos are to me. She is amazing.
.
Please be safe in nCOV or any illness People of China.My prayers is with you my Chinese brothers and sisters.PrayerForChina   JIAYOUFrom a Filipino Fan 

I really dont understand how she can make anything she does look so beautiful. Her videos truly bring out the hidden beauty of nature. Aesthetic appeal is so much vivid in her videos that I can watch them over and over again even when I dont understand anything . Lets keep supporting her
Humans sometimes forget how rich we are just with natures gift.
That dog sleeps in a better matress than me
I love all her videos that are winter themed  Its like she ensures she uses her talents to warm others  I love her grandma so much tooI wish we could send them post cards so they know where all their fans come from 
Thank you for caring for her and I can tell you shes fine right now. Because of the virus we have to stay at home and she cant update her video right now.Because shes donating some masks and some money for Wuhan and We are so honored to have such a celebrity in China. So shes fine right now  and you guys dont need to worry about her
 Did anyone notice theres a tiny spot on her nose after she did the woodwork Thats actually a tiny wound. According to her assistants post on Weibo, a scrap of bamboo stroke her nose when she was chopping. Luckily it didnt hit her eye... Better wear goggles next time 

The last few moments with the granny and the pup is just oh my god
So who is happy , when every time she uploads
, , 
This girl who lives in a province has better cam quality than pewdiepie.
cute DAWANG
It almost feels like shes living in heaven. Everything is there. While in city, we are working like slaves and having a shitty polluted life.

Thank you so much Dianxi, seeing you make this food and learning more about Chinese culturecuisine is amazing. I once told my dad that I would learn how to cook Chinese food, I know, Im a bit crazy but the internet is connecting us all around people like you. I dont look for the negative things, I look for the beautiful things that people do and what you share is wonderful. Keep going. I KNOW I will make this dish one day and itll be because you taught us how. 
After seeing her videos I have decided to change my idea of our new kitchen insted of an modern island kitchen we are going to build a traditional Indian kitchen, there is no point in being with the mainstream it may look good but doesnt feel good, I need a kitchen like this to remember my roots all my great great grannys and their recipies.. thank you so much.
The background music and the whole ambience of where she is working makes it very soothing to look at

I am from Indiana in the USA... I really enjoyed your video.  It is very educational and eye opening.  When I watch this it reminds me of Soul Food.  I did not know Chinese cuisine has it own version of cracklins pork fat crumbs.  Watching you pick fresh vegetables from the garden reminded me of my childhood when my family would do the same.  Thank you for making these beautiful videos

There is an observation Id like to expressThe greatest assest in life I think I, obviously money. The greatest liability in life is also money. The later is true as when we get money we dont know what should we do. Well .Food. Travel. Get educated. All simultaneously. Thats what money should be used for only. Because all the three ends are rewarding. More rewarding that humans in general .
The music, endless  pork fat drenched..the triangle hat, pounding vegetables, perfection
  .   
Whoever marries this woman is a lucky man.
I love that she goes and picks fresh vegetables. It makes the food look even better.

Feel so impressed when I see the food from my hometown in YouTube.

Omg this made my mouth water from start to end
  
Something about this all feels so pure and nostalgic, even though its so radically different from my own life. Im envious of the ability to go on a walk through the countryside for fresh vegetables, cooking for a whole family and seeming so content and at peace. Love your videos, and thank you for this look into another way of life.
So calming and soothing. I want to achieve this level of emotional comfort.
This is absolutely incredible. Age old skills many of us in the western world have lost making us vulnerable and unable to store food in traditional ways
    
nice way of preserving food,thank you for sharing this.
She made the god damn grease can I get  a moment of silence.

Did somebody time travel to the past and shoot this video Its weird seeing such rural lifestyle and cooking with such amazing videography...

I never a knew a pork belly video could be so peaceful and soothing
The food that you share is very delicious and interesting. Thank you for everything
Such harmony from first second to last......I dont think Ill ever experience that sense of farm to table bliss.
She must be some cousins or relatives to liziqi or at least neighbors
The cat just throw my focus off XD
  
I love you work, Im from El Salvador,  excellent

Looks great, the culture and style of cooking Im a big fan of.
so she uses VPN How did she defeat the great firewall of china

For some reason, her twisting that cabbage out of the ground felt more violent than all the meat chop she was doing.
Can I come over. Id never go home after eating. Id chain myself to the front door
Super duper..
Whatever she cook, it looks good, delicious, effortless  clean.
    ....  ...        ...
With great cooking like these, Asian kids will have no trouble eating their veggies. Eating disorders must be rare in China, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and the rest of Asia where good home cooking still prevails.
Im still thinking about how to describe your art
    

Im so glad this has English subtitles. Also I love the music, classical is my favorite
What a wholesome looking way to live
As if Im watching an emotional cooking movie... The sound, and the editing, the character, the pasion
Every single video calms the Mind in a serious beautiful way

The way of living you show us is so precious. Not even Gordon Ramsay could complain^^

This was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.Can I come live at the farm Please, I am respectful and strong, so I can work. Ill make my own home on the outskirts of village, I will not be a problem.Please, please.

Your family is so lucky to have you.  All your cooking looks delicious.  Wish I could smell and taste it  Thanks for sharing your fabulous cooking abilities.

A gorgeous woman, fantastic food, absolutely beautiful place what more could a man ask for.....I would marry her and live there in an instant, even though I wouldnt understand the language I wouldnt care I would learn the language.
When I was  my uncle Solano butchered a pig, and set it on a spit that was part of there kitchen, my aunt made hot mexican chocolate with cinommon stick slowly in a clay pot hung at a smaller spit hook. It was christmas , the odor of pig roasting over slowly and the chocolate, as it thickened.  Made me feel like I was special. Best meal ever....
Dianxi and Liziki are my two favorite YouTube channels

Wow, chinese foods are sure tasty and nice decorated. Would love to try Chinese cuisine 
Damn that pork was cooked to death, brought back to life, and cooked again.
Such cooking skills with a great deal of pride, reminds me of the women in my country, we cook the same...love to see the way these women cook without a fuss but a choice to eat what they have...bless her... 
I saw this and I say oh I wanna try this, it must be delicious
No entiendo nada pero eres genial... XDSaludos desde Venezuela...

That cat only appears once every blue moon 
Your living an awesome life. Keep it up. You can get everything fresh, having high quality food.
I, too, have a  wok at home
Watching videos like these reminds me that happiness is found in simplicity too. For many, its the most fulfilling kind of happiness. Taking care of a land, enjoying the fruits of your labour, being in tune with nature, sharing moments with your family. The fewer things you need to be happy, the happier you find yourself to be.
I like how whatever you need you take from the field and go
It has been a long time since everyone in the family sat around the table and had a dinner. I miss that time.

I watched this video for the second time today and wanna try badly the pork she cooked . It look wonderful Why dont you open a restaurant Dianxi She has a lifestyle which is so inspiring in this busy world.
I do love the your village. I wish I own a farm in your village. It looks beautiful and peaceful
All that effort and working in the kitchen, as of me.. Cooking a simple dish takes about hour. She made it look so easy to prepare.
    ...
Linda arte de cozinhar.Meus parabns daqui do Brasil

Peccato che i tuoi video non siano in italiano. Comunque sono bellissimi. Brava, un saluto dall Italia.

Despite the place and the Beautiful music and the lovely dog and the cute cat I found this video disgusting .
I love how they eat together in the end it makes my heart melt
Que delcia. Parabns.

Apart from cooking one another thing I really admire is the Family fond.As an Indian we are proud of having joint families ,three or more generations living together,respect for elders,love for each other.Thats the cultural identity common in both civilisation Chinese and Indian.The woman is sweet and adorable and her cooking skills are of high standards.
My cardiologist just fired me for watching this.
   
Liziqi and Dianxi both great vloggers and from chinaWISHING Philippines is just like China simple and peace

Her meowing back at a cat was hilarious
Just watched ur videos from the greeny island SrilankaLove your videos muchIm also doing cooking videos but in the forest in Srilankan traditioanl style and with the rhythm of the nature.
why in the hell im watching this smh
Do you remember the taste of refining lard to make oilbased meat when you were young Oil bottom meat, we call it braised meat locally. A long time ago, the ancestors invented this method of storing pork in order to prevent the pork from rotting and spoiling, and later it became a particularly delicious dish
Wow thanks for the techniques of preserving food we love chinese foods ,we also cook it in the philippines as our traditional foods especially noodles..
They say, heaven is a place on earth... Probably, this is it...
It s amazing. I want to try it.
Fresh all ingredients and no artificial flavor 
Parabns  voc  uma excelente cozinheira 
Wish can cook with this calm situation

I really love to watch her everyday.i love the lifetyle great job Hello guys i am new youtuber here wish to hug someone new here too..
I feel taking a one little short yummy journey. so comfortable feeling all the time. it would be great inspiring subject to me to draw cook life with touching stories.  
I really loved that dog 

You seem so down to earth, unpretentious, and your personality is so cute I also enjoy seeing you with your gorgeous, massive dog. Its clear that you love each other and that you take good care of him. I think for these reasons your channel is my favorite one of this type although I do enjoy the others too but it is a different mood. Im ChineseAmerican. My dad speaks your dialect. Unfortunately, I only speak Cantonese so I hope someone can translate.
The music reminds me of something I dont want to remember.
       .    .  .  
Im wondering how you clean that large pan or pot something
A ver si tenemos un poquito mas de respecto a la vida de los animales,que tienes a los  cerds y otros encerrados en una mierda de un metro por un metro, y otras Cosas que me voy a callar,en fin .Asc puro.
Hello 
Thomas.also a coolerli festyle
   


I love the way she prepared everything. The end was so lovely serving her family outside. Looks like Paradise. Keep up the great cooking.
i watch this and I feel like Im betraying Liziqi who started this kind of videos.
My grandparents would preserve pork liks this in Romania since they didnt have a fridge , it was the best thing ever . People in the countryside still do it to this day and in winter you can find it in some of the shops
The music in this video is of great value as a lullaby.
  ^^

Iam preethi like u ur food vry nice god bless u
    
Honestly, I am impressed with their cuisine, for those of us who are not from their culture, particularly I am very impressed and it is very interesting, their sauces, vegetables, meats in their different flavors, I think they are fresh, smoked or in the form of bacon , if Im not mistaken. I had the great opportunity to get to know oriental food in my country, Peru, of course not as intense as you do. I must congratulate on your videos, it is inspirational, I wish you good luck, Miss or Mrs Dianxi.

Que hermoso todo lo q haces es todo artesanal sabes as hacemos las cosas tambin en Mxico saludos desde Guanajuato Mxico
          
I love hairy tofu a lot. I miss it and I dont know where I could find and buy in Thailand.
Looks like the best cotton candy ever. Yum. Im going to look in my local grocery stores.
I like the way you film your video but Icant eat this things
I came here like hairy tofu. hell no but after watching I admit I really want to try your cooking. Looks incredible.
The comment section looks so updated that I taught it was a new video lol
if that tofu is alive ,id love to have one as a pet...ITS SO CUTE 
Im so high I thought they were little baby chickens 
i love you videos
Give some of that Tofu fur to my Bald sphynx kitty
I dont even know what Tofu is, nevermind a hairy variant.
yall are scared of mold but still eat mushrooms
Its amazing, if I had a chance to eat this, I wanna try to eat There is so many effort for making this tofu
It was recommended but It was worth it..but wait is hairy food does itChinese people Yes we make everything
Well, that moldy tofu looks delicious I gotta try some.
In fact, this is a superb food processing method. Soy protein is decomposed by mold to obtain more flavorful amino acids, which is more conducive to human digestion and absorption.
I only eat that hairy tofu if she cook it fir me.
     ,    ,    .
Estoy encantada con las recetas mostradas,  pero me gustara... que se traduzca los ingredientes utilizados. Felicito toda la forma y herramientas artesanales para cocinar 
     
Im Chinese and I didnt even know hairy tofu is a thing
I thought they were hamsters in the thumbnail
Nobody notices the great camera work and editing Kudos to the people behind these amazing videos
Just imagine getting a piece of fur or hair stuck in that, then eating it.  its too fuzzy for me 
Sla, s sei que o youtube me recomendou kkkkk. Satisfatrio assistir eles fazerem isso
I felt for a moment that hairy tofu looked censored
If my tofu looks like this, i would NEVER eat that OO  but i like this kinde of videos
Immediate reaction  THATS MOLD
You are really an inspirational personYou remind me of my home sures when I was back home. Good bless you and bless your work.
WHEN I SEE TOFU I ALWAYS REMEMBER KIM DAHYUN
What I thought I was making when I mixed all the shampoos in the shower
Idk if Im being weird or something but those hairy tofu look so cute
This is a form of tofu I have never seen before, so interesting.

Man, and I thought I was sufficient with my protein intake dayum I want that
Where I am from, when i start to see the hairy stuff on food or anything I throw them away. So do everyone else.
I have this weird urge to keep one of those tofus as a pet...
Id like to know what the season g she used at the end of the video was, looks like those tofu pieces were fermented in that big jar.
It kinda reminds me of cotten candy though Im sure it doesnt taste like it XD. I am curious about what is happening . Is it a mold or something Or just how tofo reacts over time. I have no idea.  Though its probably on my list of things to try at one point. 
Relaxing moment in my life
  
love you so much keep work, fans for indonesia
I somehow managed to read the title as there are several ways of eating h a i r after seeing the thumbnail cuz i never knew this thing existed
I thought she was holding and feeding bunnies LOL
most of you said I cant eat this  Although it is their tradition But what about cheese  It is also a bacteria that takes a long time  but the tofu was left overnight and the fire was on
   ..
The first time i came to know about this tofu is from a hong kong movie. I wondered how it taste ever since.
Cant stop watching this even after a year the tofu looks so cute and fluffy and I am drooling it must tastes good
I love how you always make tofu from scratch. 
Damn I never know it exist but it looks so good. It was so properly done in a very clean environment. I love the way you film your video too
They shouldve named it cotton tofu it sounds more appetizing than hairy tofu
No one Literally no oneMe  I dont even know what Tofu is  But it looks tasty PS OMG I got  likes  thank you all for these likes.... Im very happy 
The ending is so good I want that pot 
Still dont know what happen to the tofu cube, like when this hairy thing came from
Lots of love  Stay Safe Take Care Stay Healthy all Family
I thought those were baby chickens at first

I just love your presentation Thank you
Everything looks easy on YOUTUBE but in reality this life style is extremely hard.  If you have to think about the processes.  I hope you know that it took a few days and lots of work.

I want to know who first looked at mouldy tofu and went Im gonna eat this

Are you sure that it was edible. It looked like it had fungus on its surface 
     ... 
I didnt knew she get millions of views. Such a hard working and gorgeous woman deserves viewership and praise.
Many people making comments on hairy tofu.. its their cultural food.. we should not comment on it... cheese is also bacterial activity equivalent to fungus.. but we love eating it ..
I feel like theres just a small community of these fairies that live somewhere in the mountains, self sufficient, and multitalented with the most aesthetic shots and perfect editing, making things youve only dreamt you had the motivation, talent, and patience to do.

So amazing place to live..Fresh air and a great family i really want to live in a village like you because in the big city i cant see mountain or big tree all i can see is dust and smoke..Say hi for your family love from bali.
A lot of effort to make tofu. Yet we buy it so cheap.
     
Estou amando o canal dela Realmente  de uma simplicidade e alm disso te acalma, sem falar que ela cozinhando  lindo. Agrada os olhos da gente 
I watched and was struck by how privileged I am. I just drive to a grocery store and buy food as needed. Refrigeration and Freezing food. Very sobering watching the long process from harvesting to table. Thats true labor.
Sis makes me want to live on the mountains and build a farm
I get hairy bread when Ive left it in the cupboard and forgot about it...
Youtube algorithm someway got me into this now i want to eat tofu
         .    .             .

Wha... I thought it was bunnies in the thumbnail...
Wax it before eating.Men already know that.
Im a Filipino working here in Heilongjiang, China. Ive never seen this here but its worth trying There is a lot of Chinese food that doesnt look good but tastes awesome 
                              
I though on the thumbnail were baby chickens I am confiusion

Your video is good but not as much liziqi... its just an amazing i like to watch liziqi more

Tofu has hairsMeanwhile my bald head shine bright like the diamonds in the sky.
Just gonna assume that the hair is a type of mold
Who else thought they were baby chickens in the thumbnail.
Im kinda grateful that I dont have to put this much effort into making food because if I did, my lazy ass would be starving.

i really want to taste this hairy tofu and am totally disgusted at the same time...

The beauty of it is that she made everything from scratch. From farm to food on the tabl. An art in itself

i feel transported to a different world when i watch these videos

       
When it said hairy tofu my biomed degree immediately SCREAMED

                 
When i saw how much time and knowledge its need..iam glad i have kfc next to my home
 
   ...       ...
I clicked on this cause I thought they were kittens.
So the hair is mold, right Or could it be something else
This is so much better than watching two dudes build a pool in the middle of the woods
people in the comment is talking about how they wouldnt eat a mouldy tofu, but its the same thing like cheese or beer. It all goes through the process of fermentation. I think this tofu is delicious and everyone should try it. Its really creamy.
The bigger question here is what does it even taste like  Im so curious
Theres other Chinese girl named Liziqi who did the same thing...her cooking skills was amazing
For some reason i thought she was eating a hamster
One of the ways is to not eat it at all 
No one.....literally no onePhilippine vendors TahOoOoooOoooOoOOo
To be honest if your saying hairy tofu is disgusting then I would like to say its on the same level of cheese and beer.

soay beans milk processed so fungus will grow massively so then they can eat them in the winter . thats brilliant and u people still eat mashroms Dah
 
YouTube a year later Here you go
I remember my grandma and grandpa, seeing how you made the food, and the way you smoothen the soybeans using that tool steering stone really like my grandmas..at their hometown, long time ago, i remember them, but now is gone, as like they are gone to heaven, thank you to reminds me and keeping me more and more in love with them and forgive them
     
people nowadays dont realise how important it is to eat fermented food like stinky tofu or the furry fungal tofu here. or even kimchi or sauerkraut  Theyre amazing for your digestion
I thought it was a bunch of headless chicks
I am sitting , in my house watching all your videos eating a bag of walkers crisps beef n onion flavour lol dear me I wonder what shall I cook f tea. Lol wish  I was in your house what great food  you cook .best wishes from England UK

That fried hairy tofu looked delicious though.
 It loses its fluffiness going through the further recipes.. I thought the hair was firm by looking at the thumbnail photo lmaoBtw I agree with calling that fluffy tofu, not hair tofu. But I think its because the idea Asian people have about the word hair  is not that disgusting..I mean, if I showed my mom the name and the actual hair tofu, she would rather think its hilarious cos the tofu has denser hair than my dad And she wouldnt feel that disgusted thinking of animal hair that has dandruff or dirts on it..
amag yan sis
      ...  ...   
Yes that is fungus.
Lol when it showed the tofu being ready, I thought I was losing wifi connection.

My cousins reaction to seeing a harry tofu THATS FKIN MOLDY
Is it fungus which is grown on those cubes
I like your cooking very much. 

My adventurous side says  oh yeah . My normal American side say  are you just cooking moldy tofu  Either way I would eat it if you invited me for dinner. Now Im curious.
Hairy tofu is very taste. Someone might want to know why it is hairy. It is because of the bacteria. But this is a benificial bacterial, which transfers the tofu to be more tasty.To make fermented Tofu, it has a similar process. Normally, tofu has a very plain taste. But after this transformation, it tastes really good.
seeing how passionate the girl is making the hairy tofu is very wholesome
I discovered hairy tofu at  JOKES ON YALL
I wanna try this Actually im a fan of tofu but its first time ive watch hairy tofu I wanna know the taste

So basically its moldy tofu
   

Que es eso y porqu youtube me lo recomienda
This was recommended to me after watching a banana time lapse of its rotting process. Same fuzzy white stuff.

Tha hairy tofu.. looking  like  a hen childrens but very interesting  recipe..with the hard work...
Oh my god. Liziqi is not alone. Yeeeey

Damn that aint hairy thats mold
Everything was so cool to watch.  Im not trying to be negative in any way, I am just genuinely curious if the hair is actually mold. If it is mold, then is it safe to actually be eating. Is it like a nontoxic type of mold Ohhhhh did you expose it to sunlight to kill the bacteria.
    
Nature is paradise.
   
     
       



Olum tofu lan bu

No wonder why you have so much subscribers, this video is quiet calm and relaxing to watch. I also love how you use youre own creativity.

I have only heard of stinky tofu so this is a first for me. I feel somewhat scared of the idea of something wt a giant hairy mold on it but its not too disimilar to eating other fermented food like tempe or blue cheese.
Hello my friend Welcome hoba and mama

First time watching her channel and she share almost similar village lifestyle with another girl. The one in red hood
           
So basically its a spicy fungus covered tofu... 
everyday she walk so far to get something to cook, then eat together.. Here im from home order food by online,  then eat alone..  
Where did u learn to cook like this  Hamoni ga Hankook boon e sip      mi da.

Omg from the thumbnail I thought that was some rabbits or chicks
    
     
    ,    
Theres  something on my lawn that looks like this.
  
    
i thought from the thumbnail they were baby rabits
Hairy tofu looks like Jigglypuff.
Why did I feel that shes doing the exact same thing Liziqi does I mean, if it works for her, go ahead and do it.

Her cooking skills no doubt is like a fine art, so addictive and relaxing, but she seems to be a very trained and skilled chef, rather than an ordinary country girl as shown to be

The cinematography and editing is extremely professional The theme sounds like from Laputa castle in the sky.

Her life is so productive while me laying at bed all day because of quarantine and watch her vids.
watching her videos is like replaying my childhood. I can almost relate many things in the video that my mom did for me and my family when I was growing up. How lucky I am as her daughter.

Her channel is the purest thing Ive ever come across on YouTube.
Im  and this girl inspired me to do this , she is so hardworking love from Vietnam 
This is not just food in making. This is asthetic art 
she was more scared than granny by the popcorn machine release but still covered her grannys ear instead of her own xD cute
Wow, Talk about living a life with purpose. This is beautiful. The satisfaction you get from making with your own hands.
     .    . .
Theyre so cute. She is petite but she is so strong. Shes been doing all the work since small , thats why her hand is like  magic
Li Ziqi has a touching life story. She is an orphan raised by her grandma. After leaving her village at age , she tried many jobs, including waitress, DJ and bar singer. She return to her village in  to take care of her aging grandma and started to make Vlogs to sell her farm products initially. Her Vlogs became an instant success in China.
Her cooking and Juns cooking has this same type of elegant and homey feeling to it. It just, makes me fall in love with cooking.
even a millionier will feel jealousy with your lifestyle dear...very hardworking girl. 
       ,      
How cute is the lamb just like a dog 
Im  seconds in and the puppies and the lamb following her like wtf how can this be so cute

I love that the sheep and the dogs follows her around

i love how there are puppies and a lamb following her at the beginning uwu
      .
Are we going to talk about how big those mangos were Edit 
When she got scared of the popcorn machine 
Her and her grandma would live comfortably through a zombie apocalypse. She even has a wall surrounding her house.
I feel ashamed as a girl. shes beautiful, independent, and skillful
        
Omgosh only if we can all live eat like this young lady, well all live at least until  or older... beautiful
Omg can we talk about how adorable she was at popcorn popping I M DYING
This is the life. What a simply beautiful way to live
Where is it i wanna see this place with my own eyes 
Shes like a Disney princess with all the animals I love her little lamb
honest living ...wish I could leave everything behind and live there
I love your videos  Please feed your little dogs.  They always look so hungry
Sis makes me want to live on the mountains and build a farm
The way the little animals follow her around... shes already a princess 
I wanna be like her.. Please, its so productive and she is so hard worker
Seems like she has a more fulfilling life that most of working to pay bills
That is my dream life style 
Shes so elegant and hardworking, and there I am, hungry but too lazy to get off the couch to get some snacks
therapy expensive watching ziqis videos free
The puppies and the lil lamb are following her everywhereD so cute

when everything is so perfect it almost feels unreal and like a fantasy. Those people who think her labour is fake, i guess theyre so used to getting dissapointment from life, that its unreal to them that one girl can be so amazing and live in a life that looks like a fantasy.
 She tried to protect her grandmother but got scared herself . This is too adorable
The sheep was so cute
When she ran to go cover her grandmothers ear, that was the most caring and the most heartwarming  thing I have ever seen 
Lizqi I did not realize you could fried peanuts in dirt Im going to try it. Im also going to make healthy marshmallow snowflake candy and see how it turns out. Thank you for always having such interesting food and how to make things so simply and so ingenious
Heaven way of living 
Whos getting jealous by watching this
I feel like she gonna bring peace to the earth
I feel lazy after watching everyone work so hard.
I feel so useless when i see her doing her thing... lovely 
Still looking for that wardrobe I have to walk through to get to this magical place.....
By any chance the place you live is called HEAVEN 
The last time I wanted this, this video only have around  or  millions of views. And now, it have  Million views I am glad that more people are discovering her and appreciating her efforts.
The part where she literally dropped everything to cover her grandmas ears and then she gets scared
En qu pas vives Qu pas vives, por favor
I m coming across the great wall just to meet this lady.
         
  
Her covering her grandmas ears instead of hers but being more scared than her grandma is so cute
Dude she would be a good Studio Ghibli heroine..
I love yours every things...
I want to live this type life . 
Que coisa mais bela. Quero uma vida assim tbm
Her grandmother is absolutely adorable, everytime I see her in wintery episodes shes always bundled up in the cutest jackets and hats
You can make popcorn like that Amazingg
This is life should be. No war no drama no unnecessary pressure
liziqi.
 those little dogs and sheep walking behind her is so cute tho 
Everyday must be iWatch your channel morning and night  good djob god bless you  you and your family love you from Morocco 
SHE DESERVES WAY MORE THAN MICHELIN STARS  SHES ANOTHER LEVEL Ramsey will never get to her level 
Instead of meeting a Hollywood movie star, Id rather meet you. Bravo for finding the purer essence of life.
  
She is so connected with nature like any human supposed to be. Sad that we totally lost our connection with nature and its raw energy. Thats why we are angry and depressed in the cities.
I admire her work ethic.  I wouldnt be able to do anything without running my mouth or sweating.  The grease wouldve popped me while cooking and Im a weenie so Id be bitching about that.  My dog would be begging to be picked up, lambs hollering, just a country mess.
Shes the ideal woman  decent clothing hardworking.......and that place is just awesome... thats where I wanna live 
I love when the animals follow her around wherever she goes  they look so happy and excited
          
Those mango cones look yummy
So, Iv requested that Netflix add youturn you into a tv series Everyone, you should do the same She deserves it

A simple life is so attractive. It goes to show complications are not beneficial

Spicy beef jerky
Dried mango
Peanut sesame brittle
Roasted chestnuts
Popcorn
Salty sunflower seeds
Fried peanuts
Crispy fried egg roll egg liquid g, milk g, plain flour g, honey, granulated sugar g, corn oilunsalted butter g
Snowflake crisp nonstick pan important, marshmallow g, milk powder g, cranberry, chestnuts, cookies, dried strawberries, corn oilunsalted butter g. The ratio of marshmallow, milk powder and butter is so important. The crisp will not be so hard or too soft, but chewy at the right ratio. 
When uncle opened the corn popper Ziqi runs to cover grandmas ears, then jumps and screams herself.This was so cute, how can I not smile and be happy
I too want to live a life where there is no one to interfere in my life where I could grow vegetables myself before my meal in my small farm and there is no needless peeping around. i get irritated by people who peep at me. they do not believe in living life peacefully, but spend their lives in mischiefs of others.
Wow Super woman...  so efficient...  She and her family will never go  hungryDoes she ever stop.  I get tired just watching her preparing and prepping  food all day long.  The food always looks so delicious and professionally prepared. Thankyou for inviting us into your living space
Why are we going to war when there is so much to enjoy peacefully from mother nature
Congratulations  Million

The way the pets following her...is so adorable...love from india
The way they make popcorn its just amazing
I Love the puppers. They are so adorable. Cute interested helpful curious they want to learn all their Masters talents.  Look to them...they want to spend time with their Beautiful Macgyver Human and sweet kind Grandmother. You no longer eat Dogs Cats now. So I hear.  Happy about that if true.    No Im not a PETA person I simply adore Animals and sweet Grandmothers esp Delicious Flower cakes.

Im so glad YouTube suggested me this video Its for sure among the most beautiful videos Ive ever watched. Everything is so carefully done and the editing is so sensible. Im just in love with the channel. And the girl who cooks and does everything havent found out her name yet is precious. She looks like a greenforest fairy... Please keep doing this amazing job 
Snow White, Cinderella cant even compare to her.
She is so hardworking, doing millions of things every day. I feel like I am too lazy...
       
Seeing her makes me want to go to my village and live on my own...making small house ..gardening,farming
Muy lindo video, solo falta darle atencin a los perritos son muy tiernos.
She should  release  a recipe  book,  it will be  easy for us 
In fact this video has like k dislike made me completely lost faith in humanity.
Does anyone else agree that everything she makes looks absolutely Delicious
Did anyone elses mind explode when she pulled out those sunflower seeds
So cute the sheep
Wowww nice view and abundant blessings
That physical type of life full of colours, fresh air, products straight from the nature, organisation to every preparation creates calmness in my soul Your videos are an oasis in my difficult, anxious city life. I love watching you You make my day God bless you Keep it that way
Yall, I would love to trade my city life with this life.
Totally Amazing 
Am I the only person who wants to see Gordon Ramsays reaction to her Lol

I just found your channel today and absolutely love it I love the editing, music, quietgentleness to your videos. Your environment is amazing You live a very blessed life. I wish I could live with you, be your sister and learn everything I could from you
She should become the brand ambassador of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC. She is inspiring millions of people around the globe to opt for more sustainable and organic living. I wish and pray that her efforts reach larger and larger audience with each passing day and she becomes an agent of great changes in future SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF NATURE LONG LIVE THE PRINCESS Love 
Two little puppies look like hungry.
Who doesnt have desire to live as she does
All I wanna know is why we dont make popcorn like that that microwave bullshit in my pantry is nothing compared to that awesome explosion
 a cutie, isnt it Covering her grandmas ear and then a seconds later... 
I wanna see her feed the pups cause shes straight up ignoring the cuties
i love the popcorn part shes trying to cover her grandmas ears
My god, I love this channel Everything looks so perfect.
,      ,   
 so cute when shes obviously a afraid of explosion but still covers her grandmothers ears 
This is better to watch than any kind of hollywood movies
I would love to visit and just be immersed into their everyday culture. These videos bring my soul so much peace and happiness.
Her videos came to my attention by my yearold daughter, she loved watching her videos on YouTube. Now we are watching it together and we both are fascinated and aweinspiring by her works, we are learning Mandarin and this video will help us to know a little more about the traditional Chinese food etc.
The cinematography, the content, the editing skills. This is the most perfect video in youtube.
shes got quality control for sure
I feel guilty watching this video and there isnt a single ad. Some people make worst content and run ads about every minute or two.
   
John  For God so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten Son Jesus Christ, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish, but have eternal life. 
As a Chinese,I am really happy to see people from different countries appreciate and love ziqis video.

Dear God The amount of work this beautiful woman does is insane And with such finesse too... Its wonderful to see her share the fruits of her hardwork with her grandmother...
Many people think shes from japan but the truth is shes from china lol
     .  .      
What Ghibli film is this
All this treats looks so delicious Perfect for Halloween party  And they look very healthy 
Wonderful nature 
How can these type of work be any less than what educated women do in officeso divine
     
I feel so bad now picking up my phone and ordering food to be delivered to my door
What a smart girl she is and when she is cooking she doesnt want her mothers helpWhat a grownup girl
Im amazed every time by her.  She is the hardest working girl Ive ever seen sure there are many others but speaking for myself.  Beautiful life, beautiful being, and beautiful work.  
What a beautiful faerie like place in which you live A lot of lovely fruits, nuts and resources to make your treats with as well. You are obviously very talented and the calm, hardwork and dedication can be seen in your videos... Passion, too  All of the food looks delicious You and your Grandma are too cute.  And the animals 
What on this earth could possess a person to even think of hitting the dislike button Smh...
I thought she was making all those food for some gathering or events but...... WoWw she has lots of food at home

This video shows the most traditional way of Chinese making popcorns, oh dear lord, all my childhood memories. Ziqi, love you.

Thanks 
If you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about Liziqi  Li Ziyi 

In , Li Ziyi fell to the ground in Mianyang, Sichuan. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Later, her father died, and Li Ziyi became an orphan. His stepmother didnt treat her well. Li Zizhen mentioned on Weibo that he had had a halfdead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten.

Grandpa and Grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take Li Ziyu home and live. When Li Ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. At the age of , Li Ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an year wandering life. Her first life was very hard. She slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months.

Li Ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of  yuan. In order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. Later, when talking about the matter, Li Zizhen frankly said I didnt say that I liked music at that time, just to live, I felt that it was well paid.

In , because grandma was ill once, Li Ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. Being closer, I feel more at ease.

After returning, Li Ziyi opened a Taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. In , under the influence of his younger brother, Li Ziyi was exposed to the short video platform Meipai. Until , seeing that his younger brother had some fans on Meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of Taobao business, Li Ziyi reentered Meipai to prepare for his own video program.

The reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment.

In an interview with the living room of Sina Club, Li Ziyi mentioned, All these things that are selfsufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. In the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places.

In the beginning, Li Ziyi gave himself a topic called Four Seasons Change, Eat While You Eat. After the suggestion of Meipai editor, it became Ancient Food and it is still used today.

In September , a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for Li Ziyu to get more attention in the future. Sina Weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support.

As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Liu Tongming brought her Weibo resources support.

One day in September , Li Feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private Weibo message from Mr. L. Mr. L expressed his love for Li Ziyus video content, felt that he had fulfilled his Taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her.

For a long time after that, Li Ziyi received Mr. Ls private letter. It would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. This is usChinas proud traditional culture should be seen by people in China and around the world. Mr. L said in a private message.

At first, after seeing these private messages, Li Ziyi didnt care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. Until one day, Mr. L came to the city where Li Zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. Mr. Ls politeness and clear logical thinking made Li slowly drop his initial alert.

This accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of Li Zizhen. Not long after the meal was over, with the help of Mr. L, Li Zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on Sina Weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing Li Zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head.

This experience is partly recorded in a diary of Li Zizheng that year. Some insiders close to the senior executives of Weinian Technology confirmed to Tencents Shenwang that the Mr. L is actually Liu Tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. Daxiong Liu, the founder of Wei Nian Technology, an MCN company to which Li Zizhen now belongs.

On December th, the reading volume of a Weibo topic labeled Is Li Ziyi a cultural output climbed to  million. Li Zizheng was once again on the hot search list.

The video created by Li Ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now.

Extensive overseas communication is an important reason for Li Zihuans renewed attention. Some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional Chinese culture and cuisine. Others think that her video is not completely true To reflect Chinas rural life.

Even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a DJ, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life Its still just a fiction for character setting.

An insider of Weinian Technology told Tencents Deep Web that Li Ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by Li Ziyi himself. The popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. In fact, both Li Zihuan and the microreading team behind him were quite lowkey, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs.

Until August , , Li Ziyis eponymous Tmall store officially opened. Six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over , and sales of over  million. A year later, the total sales of  products displayed in the Li Zizhen flagship store exceeded . million, with total sales reaching  million.
The value behind Li Ziyis IP is being quickly tapped.

Li Ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. But now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements.
According to Tianyan search, Deep Web shows that MCN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., which Li Ziyi belongs to, was established on February , , with a registered capital of RMB . million. According to the introduction, Wei Nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates KOL into IP through short videos and extends to consumer brands.

The information of Qixinbao shows that there are more than  pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark Li Zihuan. The applicant companies are Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd. The product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, Financial property management, catering and accommodation.

Not only that, Wei Nian also has inextricable links with Li Ziyus companies.

According to the eye inspection, Li Jiajia should be the original name of Li Ziyu established Sichuan Ziyu Culture Communication Co., Ltd. on July , , and Wei Nian is its shareholder, holding  of the shares. Supervisor, Li Jiajia holds  of the shares.

According to other data, there are as many as  beneficiary companies behind Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., including Greenland Holdings, ZTE, Xinhua Media, Vanke, Light Media, etc. .
Among the shareholders of Weinian Technology, Sina Weibo is particularly eyecatching.

From Wei Nian Technology to Sina Weibo, Li Ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to.
In her own words, she changed from a little transparent to a person who is so useless to society. After entering the public view and being noticed by more people, Li Ziyis sense of responsibility has also become heavier.
I want to do what I can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, nonheritage cultural craftsmen, and I want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. Li Ziyi said.

 I cant stop laughing haha shes so cute


Her videos are what I use to unwind at the end of a long day and helps me see things in a new perspective.
 reminds me from one of the scenes in Mulan 
She looks like Mina from Twise kpop girl group.
Its so fanny whes she covered the ears of grandma and jump coz shes scared

THE PUPPIES every time I see them I die of cuteness overload.
  .              .
 ,   
imagine Kylie Jenner doing  of that
 wait what how can a mango can not have seed in it 
thank you for sharing your daily life through videos and making people jealous of your life  and realize that life is beautiful. this world is beautiful without war. Greetings of peace 


Hiii i watched this video times. I want to visit ur village
I wish to try some of the snacks.
Liziqi, youre such an inspiration to me  Love your videos  There is so so much to be learned from you. Sending you lots of love and light.  just small detail, there is a sunflower seeds not melon seeds used in video  
  ,  
she behaves like a K Drama heroineLovely 
You are a LEGEND Liziqi I miss this kind of life. Your place is a paradise, surrounded by flowers and vegetables, and your cute friends. I like your Puppy and the lamb. Your Popo is so lucky to have you with her, a very loving grand daughter. I love all your videos. I will try your recipes from scratch. Also, i love your Oven. Its unique. Love from Houston, TexasMimi 
This is a wonderland and she is a wow queen of it
Wait a minute... isnt you tube is banned in China, I think its illegal in China to use you tube
Liziqi

I love this episode....Ive watched it many times. I wish I had recipes for each thing
YouTube, sometimes I question the things you recommend to me. This isnt one of them. Thank you for this, this is lovely.
This channel is really awe inspiring. From the cooking and food presentation, and the music chosen. Totally transports me to a fantastical realm. The production is really top quality. Super fan here thank you
    ,  
I rewatched the part where the popcorn machine exploded so many times, watching Liz cover her grandmas ears and jump was so funny
Happy Chinese New year my motivated girl  wish you luck in your life.
I just found a virtual paradise  This is so beautiful. 

Ngon tht
This girl is a perfect miracle... A hard past and now look at her... Shes living a happier life... She is my idol 
She is the real life disney princess...her life so full of life ...i love the part where she ran towards her grandma to close her ears
Her youtube channel is only  year old and she already has M subscribers and more that M views on every single video, some of them have more that M views.This girl is amazing 
Meanwhile, Im all Ugh, I cant believe its taking so long when my Ubereats order hasnt come yet
Shes so strong. Those baskets balanced on her shoulders are heavy. Pomelos and ponkans are watery fruits, and theyre really heavy.
.. if she is a dream then i dont want to wake up..

After watching this  I hate my life and I feel like Im not healthy at all

Sheeps following along with the dogs are too cute
That moment when she covers her grandmas ear so that the grandma will not startle but turns out shes the one who actually startled 
She is amazing, but so many negative comments about your own lives.. you have to find your own balance and beauty in your life It doesnt have to be escaping the city life completely, or getting rid of technology.Make time for what makes you happy next to your work and responsibilities. Shes decided that this is her way to happiness.You might think that you need this, but you could be wrong. Life is long enough to find out whatll make you feel accomplished, we just need to stand up and start to search
best youtyouber i like you so much

The puppies and lamb following you are so cute. Such well behaved little cuties. Poor puppies got scared of the popcorn machine. So precious
 When she called the Uncle selling popcorn, that was so precious. Reminds me of when I was in the province, whenever an ice cream or bread selling uncle pass by, I would shout loud to call them.
Fairy tales type of girl, beautiful hardworking...You are real Cinderella...Your house, garden , forest., Utensils , everything is like a fairy tale story...
What a intresting video

...     ,                ....I love you very much, even though I am Korean, but I do not have a difference because I do not differentiate between the two countries. Rather, they must be united by love and sincerity, but some people do not support that.... ...                .                 ....Koreli olmama ramen seni ok seviyorum, ama hibir farkm yok nk iki lke arasnda ayrm yapmyorum.  Bunun yerine, sevgi ve samimiyetle birlemelidirler, ancak baz insanlar bunu desteklemez....     ,     ,                   ,         ,        ...

Su nombre es Li Ziqi. Ella qued hurfana desde muy temprana edad, as que fue criada por sus abuelos. Se mud a la ciudad y vivi all por un tiempo desde que tena  aos tuvo que trabajar como camarera y luego tuvo la oportunidad de trabajar como Dj, pero cuando su abuelo falleci, regres al campo para cuidar de su abuela. Especialmente ella fue quien la cri.

Shes so caring, she covered her grandmothers ears from that small explosion
I would love to be her apprentice 
.

This video reminded me the time when I was smaller and lived on the border with China, we used to go to China sometimes on the weekends in winter and have these traditional sweets, sold on the streets  fruits in caramel on a stick, and when I licked it in  degrees my tong glued to caramel...

 wow they also fires a fire  like that ,same here , we also do the same  ,miss winter
She lives in heaven

Shes so cute when she cover her grandmas ears, but when the pop corn pops she jumps. She also surprises her grandma with that kind of crispy hot cake or whatever you call it. Shes so sweet 
And why people compare her with Disney Princess  She is much more than that 
She is a brilliant girl because she knows everything. She is hardworking girl.
This video makes me want to live in that peaceful village instead of crowd city
Every time i feel lazy. I watch this girl and it inspires me to work harder..
Her dogs and lamb is always beside her. Lil pals ^^
That lil pup deserves to relish that stuff.
Probably her videos are the only ones I watch without skipping. Because I would be completely mesmerized by her work.
Those puppies are soooo cute

Shes getting more and more beautiful living in such peaceful and fresh area.
This is my most favourite video from liziqiii channel

I cant stop watching. TASTY better watch out
Shes like a Disney character
When you got everything you need in your backyardforest. Demn
Shes so cute tho like she can cook, loving, caring her grandmapa such beautiful granddaughter and wife material 
So this is what ONE WITH EVERYTHING FEELS LIKE.
I have insurmountable respect and admiration for this woman. Not just from what I see in the videos, but the fact shes bringing back to new life an archaic way of doing things. Because of her Ive learned a lot about culture, process and reaction. Also because of her, Ive gained several new skills.
Im so happy to see someone who can show the the different life of Chinese people, neither just the miserable one in some Chinese movies and western news, nor modern good life in some big cities from Chinese media. From the comments, I found most of us, no matter where are you from, share the similar value and aesthetics. We are not so different.
I love how she love her grandma so much. 
Very hardworking young lady. A very busy day.
Wanted to cook something...but instead i ended up looking at this beautifull girl for more thank  h  Im just in love with this channel  Congrats 
All the love from India 
 
                 
The picture quality is so good. Not to forget, this girls cooking and handicrafts skill is great too.

What is your name
            
Is this how she really lives Wow... must be nice....
I just thought to myself this is beautiful when I saw the beginning but when the Digimon music actually kicked in at  I genuinely fell in love with this channel.
How the heck did this come in my recommendationBut soo beautiful tho woww
Happy Chinese New Year Beautiful Lady and to Popo  Im so inlove with all your videos... Well Done
Beautiful..talented..respectful to her elders knows how to do EVERYTHING..if the apocalypse ever happens Im looking for her
I find this so interesting and relaxing. I dont understand all the dislikes...

Like her personality she is full of energy and so talented with everything no matter what if it is cooking or hard labor.Your pets are so adorable.
What is hwthrow

K dislike Im sorry for them. Come on. The animals love her too. That should tell you something

,.
She is like a dream princess. Best of luck dear.From,Bangladesh.
Everything she does is just poetry in motion bless her
Ive binge watched this beautiful womens videos for the past hour and Im just at awe by how much she knows.
Gordon Ramsay would absolutely fall in love with this place if he ever visited her. True cooking from scratch

  

she just inspire everyone to live a simple but a meaningful happy life ..
After seeing this, I can attest that Chinese food and culture is great I am originally from India btw
Theres something so serene and beautiful about the way she works
This is literally how Chinese people lived back in the past, as technology improves, less people live like this. its amazing that a women like her still continues to do things the traditional way, it reminds me of the past. You can tell from traditional old Chinese buildings, its amazing, all handmade, people back then are so damn smart. Now people all uses machines for everything, and yes its efficient, but it feels different.
How can anyone dislike her effort and creativity.Humans r so annoying somethimes.
She owes this to her grandpa. She must have been remembering him while making this furniture. Dont you think 
I cant believe what I am seeing. This girl is incredible.
i am thoroughly convinced she is a forest spirit living with an old tree spirit
I need to go buy a Billy to IKEANobodyLiziqi hold my bamboo
Me making face masks, proud of myself.Her another level.
When a guy say girls cant build anything without their help
She has an angelic look and Im fascinated by her craftsmanship and strength. Her grandmother approved. Maybe she learned the skills from her.
Ikea We make the best furniture in the world.Liziqi Hold my Bamboo
Ill just go ahead and say it I am so in love with this woman. Is it all legit or a bit fake I dont care. Sometimes one just has to take something at face value and enjoy it for what it is. In her videos I see the way we are supposed to live.
This beautiful  young lady has some serious carpentry skills...Lovely too watch her use some ancient Chinese carpentry methods to build those fantastic looking furniture items. May you live a long life and prosper in your heritage....

That plant is a bless, specially for DIYers. We wish Bamboo grew all around the world. 
I like how feminine and strong and disciplined she is.
We should have more strong and respectful female figures on YouTube like her.


hey i want to leave in that place with u its quite peaceful environment.
Me I need new sofa. Goes to IKEAHer I need new sofa. Goes to forest
  
I laughed at the end when she was like, Oh wait, let me go get changed.
Eres maravillosa Todava no creo que sos real,,puedo creer que sos mgica Gracias 

During interview,Boss So what can you do Ziqi Yes.




I hate when ppl reduce her only to a cooking channel. Shes an engineer, a homemaker, the ultimate DIY channel imo

I heard from her older fans that before she did these type of calmcountrylife videos she made woodworkinghandicraft tutorial videos and honestly I belive them

What a beautiful scenery and a comfortable lifestyle is a dream that many people have always wanted to pursue.
I feel like even her grandma is amazed by her granddaughters many talents.




Read her story from online.Her parents passed away when she was a kid. She was raised by her grandparents in rural countryside. Her grandpa passed away when she was . Her grandma didnt have enough money to raise her. So, she left home to look for jobs.  years after, her grandma was sick. She moved back home to take care of her grandma...Tried many things, she discovered a way for living by making videos and food blogger. Her success is not only her talents, but also she courage and spirit  never give upOnly a person who truly love life can make such beautiful artistic pieces.
     ,             
Por favor coloquem legendas em ingls e ou espanhol para que um nmero muito maior de pessoas possa apreciar melhor seu trabalho

Thank you YouTube recommendations I didnt know I needed this in my life

I knew bamboo was strong, but I didnt know it was this strong.
She reminds me of a character from some Ghibli movie, disciplined and focused, living in a beautiful environment.

Serenity so beautiful to see her Amazing being graceful and divine

This is so beautiful, as is everything you touch You have such a gift, with plants and with people. So much love inside of your soul.  You truly take away my anxiety when I watch your videos. I appreciate the calmness and feeling at one with nature.  Your videos provide that to us all.

This is whats real inspiration for me, nowadays we got technology and developped things so we kinda lazy compared the the past generation, Even tho Im from GenZ but I love hardwork and everything handmade cuz I feel that way u will be  proud of everything u made by u and only u.One day I will have my own house, farm,and everything made by me..
This was the first video I saw from her Im still amazed...

Liziqi or whoever edited this should make a movie because damn I feel like I just went through a spiritual journey with this bamboo couch
This is amazing and her talent takes me on to another level. Do we have humans like this still in existinance. I rest my case  and feel embarrassed of myself . This talent and hard work somehow needs to be passed on to our lazy south africans

When I saw the thumbnail few days ago in my recommendations, I thought maybe its some sort of short clips of drama videos so never clicked. I wasnt expecting this... She is so cool...
THE BACKGROUND SOUND IS SO ASMR TYPE SO PEACEFULL
Not to sound dramatic but being an artist and seeing her work until the sun came down , I cried,  I love how art can make us forget about everything around us and in the end that work created something really beautiful.

Internet builds stuff with ramen noodlesThis blessing nah, let me show you
Would you believe that the initial construction of major skyscrapers in Hong Kong, the scaffolding was all bamboo. There is a documentary on this. Truly amazing.
Madam, Im both humbled and hypnotized by your skill, craftsmanship, art and beauty.
You never cease to amaze me. I love your videos and they help with the stress a lot. I wish the captions on YouTube would work a bit more properly, or just learn the language. Point is, youre amazing. Please keep doing more videos and take care of yourself and granny.  
I bet her grandma was same level talented and beautiful  years ago.
This is where IKEA got their inspiration  This lady is the best role model for people everywhere.

this inspired me to do my home work and apply for jobs i have social anxiety and have quit jobs due to anxiety. this makes me feel like i do nothing all day, i should be making furniture for my grandparents
Is there anything this woman cant do Im so amazed by her talents and skills
Amazingly beautiful place and really pretty girl doing incerdible stuff. Feels like another world.
i have no word to describe her , extremely talented
GREECE        liakos gr Neo petritsi  serron
My dad saw this and was so excited.He was born in Hunan China in , a province next to where this girl lives.  He couldnt believe this little girl made furniture that he remembers sleeping on during summer to escape the heat when he was a child.He was impressed that she made it with he same finesse as the old masters did when he saw them do the work.He left home before he turned into an adult to fight the communist and lived most of his life in Taiwan as an R.O.C. veteranTeacher, and he hasnt seen furniture like this, made in such a way, since he left his childhood homeSo... this is legit
I have been working my bamboo house in my durian garden, I wish u would be my wife....that is helpfull babe...
Eating what u grow  amazingHaving tea on a freashly made bench made by you  next lvl
This is absolutely incredible
It is impressive No workbench, no complex machinery, literally handmade

Sorry li ziqu really sorry i am from india and the relationship between india and China is not too good In my old memories I realy hate Chinese but after watching youI really really like chinese.... I learn that they are not too bad I you are heart by my words please really sorry Love from india 
My grandma have the same when she was young her and her sister always play chess using a cap of pastic bottle until she had sooo many bamboos
Cant believe ppl like her still exist in this artificial generation
As a woodworker myself, its interesting to see the way the same tecniques are utilized on such a different material to achieve a very flattering result. In particular, i liked the heat bending for the bamboo table.Its all very simple, nothing particularly difficult. But these simple tecniques and materials are used to achieve a great result.
Oh my god I cant even assemble IKEA furniture properly 
    
there is so much work and discipline in this video, but you are so graceful that it seems effortless...
And here I am still trying put together this ikea piece

See. It does exist. Femininity, physicality, and master craftsmanship. True beauty.
A lot of respects to Liziqui 
Was expecting her to fly through the bamboo forest on the way back.

Eu sou do Brasil e dei 
Wow the atmosphere is amazing and beautiful. All the flowers and trees 
This girl is amazing
Youre very talented Very calming video. Great to see resourceful craftsmanship. Thanks for sharing
Beauty with brain
Nobody YouTube recommendations Lmao you wanna see how to build a bamboo sofa 
Youre so hard working girl really
and I think getting up to charge my phone is hard work
Shes so breathtakingly beautiful, one half of my family comes from her province. The south all along the Yangtze is so beautiful too, having grown up in the northwest corner near the border of Kazakhstan, I really wish I grew up here instead.
Omg shes so talented n amazing..Nice nice
GENUINELY one of the most fascinating things ive ever watched.

All her movements are very quick and energetic, but incredibly precise. Amazing to watch a master at work.
Kesini gara berita di tv
Bro this was incredible The amount of patience this had to have taken is unreal. Props to this girl who committed to making these beautiful masterpieces.
Full makeup, money spent on stuff, following the useless ephemeral in daily life make everyone ashamed here. She seems one of the most beautiful girls even without heavy makeup and decorating herself. The aura of true princess is somewhere your heart knows, your talents that shine through all your life and the one next to you.
So amazing 
No words for your efforts girl,Hats off on you
Shes beauty, shes grace. Shes got a way with her hands  Princess 
I put off cleaning my shower for like  days coz I cant be assed, meanwhile she has built a houseful of furniture, formented enough food to last a year and cooked  amazing meals from scratch. She is my hero 
You are intelligent and extraordinary..Love from Bangladesh
People who disliked works in IKEA
I want a girlfriend like her, just amazing 
Shes the perfect example of I can do everything
Words cannot express how happy I was to find this beautiful channel. My mother died last week totally unexpectedly and watching your videos is cleansing my soul. Thank you from the bottom of my heart x
she carries that all the way alone my goodness, wish I could give her a hand though she might not need any.she is one hell outta superwoman
Im here complaining about the instructions on how to build a trampoline
Bear Grylls I can survival in this forest for a month. Liziqi hold on, let me build a city here.
M
Me The perfect girl doesnt exis...YouTube Recommemded
Not only being a talented chef, carpenter, artist and so on,  Ziqi also demonstrated her bravery of conquering any difficulty with her bare hands, and in a skillful and graceful way. For kids living in cities nowadays, Ziqi is a precious role model for them.
Do you ever look at a comment and realize, Man, that wouldve been a great idea.
Incredible Im glad I came across this video.
I was about to type she needs to make pillows and then she started making pillows
Straight to the point and no edmThis is 
And I complain about assembling my IKEA side table....which I STILL manage to screw up somehow.
Shes so gorgeous and the way she works just captivates me. 
   ,             

this might sound weird but you doing these things make me happy to be alive
Maturity comes when one accept dislike  ignore it.
Heres the translationI have been wanting to buy a sofa set but a good eye catching set costs over k RMB. Then last week I remembered my grandpa made a sofa set before. So I took his idea and try to make it. This is bamboo season, ideal to use to make a back basket, a chair and a rack and will not get infested with bugs. I made a back basket, a folding fan and a tray before but never made a sofa set. I made a lot of mistakes but with trial and error I finally made a monk bed, an empress chair and a tea table. Very happy, very happy. Coming from a smilely person who just saved a ton of money.

I find no words...Only Respect...
Oh, god, im so sorry. Bless his sweet and accomplished and something very beautiful who is himself like him to be like him lake lake lake lake come on
But honestly she got mad Crafting skill, here me with all kind of equipment and machine but cant even build a simple box
She uses that Cleaver for everything. Where can I buy one
I love of all Liziqis videos She is a true Spirited and Hardworking young woman. In fact, six months ago I was all over the internet looking for Life Skills Simple Life for a character I am writing about and instantly it recommended me to  Liziqi
 and  XiaoXis Culinary Idyll. I follow both of them and thanks to their vast knowledge I have more understanding about Chinese tradition among other life skills. I have found myself now growing my own veggie garden small apartment, I am trying out Shu embroidery, and building my own furniture FB Marketplace old items to reusable and decorating my place. Yea I dont have bamboo in my backyard but I make them as I go, and all this thanks to Liziqi and XiaoXi    
My brain now ive learnt i want itMy hands no you dont.
This girl just took Minecraft to a whole other level,Meanwhile im struggling to put up my IKEA furniture up
My brain ill go early to sleep tonightMe at am building sophisticated old furniture from bamboo
i wish i was just as talented as her, shes so amaaazing omg
i would rest for probably a year or so, after carrying that much weight on my shoulder all the way through the woods.I ADORE HER SO MUCH GOOD GOD
I think we just found the perfect match for Primitive Technologies guy
Shes so gorgeous, yet super skilled She made me question my life. Im a nerd   behind a computer, so this is a new world to me haha
She can make furniture, clothes, food, and stay beautiful. Forget Super Woman she should be what girls aspire to be like. Amazing, shes just amazing.
Awww Shes so hard working and loving to her grandma 
 its so satisfying how she measured the gap so accurately that when it folds around the bamboo it stands at . What an intelligent woman
Im so jealous of her long beautiful hair
 Do you know why shes touching her head She is rubbing her hair with the needle, so the needle gets lubricated by hair oil. Very traditional way of doing it Ive seen my mother doing this way when I was very young
Me takes an axe with me to cut the trees Liquizi takes an litchen knife
This is so freaking amazing and the ending was so cute  Wholesome content right here
Talented and beautiful woman. I found happiness just watching this.
Those k dislikers are those who are jealous of you
Is this the ultimate waifu
She makes me wanna be...productive

Nxi ji gi nn de rn, jing fichng goxng, w xingxn. Shngd zh nn chnggng h jindn. W liz bx
        
She doesnt have time to gossip, to complain, to sue people, watch tv, compare herself to others, to envy or have jealousy, looking at social media, she is just the best role model for women everywhere.  I love the way she loves her grandma.
I think that Liziqi never gave heart to anyone...
Is it just me thinking how nice the colour grading in the video is Okay.
This is officially a therapy for me. Seeing a multi talented young woman like you fills me of joy. Good job 
Each of those bamboos are heavy. The natives here in Philippines cant even carry  at once. This woman is immortal
This lady is my hero, she makes so many amazing things I never thought possible even as a craftsperson myself
Watching this makes me think What am I doing with my life

K dislikes from ikea employees all over the world.
Bamboo is very strong yet looks easy to cut and carve. Now I want all my furniture to be from bamboo. I thought my DIY were nice. Hers is amazing.
The knowledge of knowing the characteristics of the wood and creativity is just astonishing.
I really dont understand why people would dislike this 
yeah hi, police Id like to call in a complaint about my neighbor. yeah shes outside at am making beautiful furniture, and its ruining my ability to live in denial about my useless existence
Just assuming we have all been gathered together randomly by YouTubes random algorithm Lets take a second to praise the lord above

She is no actress. She handled bamboo like expert which takes years to mater. I know because when I was younger I made kites using bamboo 
This is soo calming and soothing . Its like getting stressfree . God this girl is super talented
More than talented and creative, I really have enjoyed watching her handcrafte and handling bamboo, and finally the outcome is amazing  ...
After watching several of her videos, I am very much convinced that there is nothing this woman cant do
Nhn e nh th nhng sc khe v bin

The pencil behind the ear must be a universal carpentry thing.
People who disliked this are clearly jealous of her lifestyle.
EXTRAORDNRIO
The forest is her free IKEA store.
How many skills she has She can be a cook, Taylor and she can make a furniture. Plus she seems never get tired and physically strong 
She is so talented, this is how I would like to live
Its a interesting lifestyle she has. She makes stuff from the things she finds, a very Eco friendly way of living. I wouldnt pull it off. Respect.
   
Im stunned that she casually went out, grabbed some bamboo from the forest and then made this 
The K dislikes are insecure they cant do what she can.
Me calling two of them for just chopping the bamboos
When you mastered every ikea product and dont know what to do
Her and her grandma deserve all the happiness and blessings in the world
She is so productive. I feel my whole life was a waste... I wanna be like her. she is simply amazing
I cant even follow an IKEA instructions manual. Hella props to her omg.
All Glory to Jesus Christ, May Jesus bless you.  I love that bgm

This is wonderful Mam
Her videos were introduced by my kids Chinese teacher. When my kid showed me this video, I told my kids, nah, do you really believe on that Well,  weeks later, as I became addicted to those videos myself, I believe more and more her talent and strength. I truly appreciate that there are still such pure and peaceful minds out there, to inspire all generations.
  
This is what mothers need to teach their daughters not how to become a princess, Cinderella or Frozen yet be the Proverb  woman.

My inspiration 
loveed from  me
This lady is what i call Wonder Woman 
Watching this video I saw elegance in her movement as she cut through, bent, and shaped the bamboo is so many ways...but with her elegance there was a sense of strength and hard work put into the making of the furniture. Watching this calmed me and I felt a sense of relax. I love this video, and I love how you made it with only bamboo and other utensils.
What a women so clever and beautiful as well

I think Bamboo is such a gift from God.  Lightweight, strong, hollow and flexible.  It has a thousand uses.  Amazing plant.
Primitive skills and eco friendly techniques. 
Really amazing 
Okay, now I know what selfsufficient means. This woman is incredible
You have to be the most unhappy and miserable human being on earth to hit thumbs down on a woman making her own furniture from scratch
A Chinese with absolutely zero haters...
Watching this makes me feel like us humans were supposed to live this way.
these videos are honestly the solution to my stress
She is amazing. She is so much talented. I like her most.who like him too

OMG How strong she is..I have personally experienced cutting and lifting these bamboo trees. Although  those trees look thin and light, truely it is not. Those are very heavy, strong and cannot control due to its easticity.. I was really surprised by seeing she is lifting  or  full bamboo trees.. OMG.... it might be the power of her healthy foods.GOOD LUCK

When I was  years old I used to see the mason workers used to work in our hone for various reasons. From there, as a hobby, I start to do creative carpentary. But, Li is really extra ordinary who just used Bamboo ingredients to build bamboo furnitures. Thank you Li, to teach us more traditional carpentery.
I remember my childhood to her pitching water using bamboo,caring woods in your back or shoulder.. i wish i watch this since then because its very educational and realistic ..thank you i wanna do everything i watched when i go back to my country and share my knowledge with my beloved husband because he is a farmer and i learned a lot from him too..keep safe and long life to your grandma..
Wonderful girlAlmost professional in her activities
I think there are more non chinese people than chinese people watching her videos.
i am watching this epesode several times, love it so much

I dont even know how I got here, but I love this
Not only she is pretty but the stuff she makes are pretty aswell Hatsoff to this lady 
She be out here making a while ass livingroom set with her bare hands and some of yall cant put an end table together without instructions
Sexist woodwork is a mans jobThis woman observeEdit Sry i thought bamboo some sort of wood because of how strong it is, also thankies for the likes 
  
I dont know why I watch stuff like this, I guess because its peaceful to me, and it brings peace to mind.  The music, her  Surroundings. The flowers, and the work she put into The furniture.  is  Relaxing
What its actually like crafting bamboo DIYs in Animal Crossing lol
I can hear Jackie Chans voice sayingChinese bamboo dont break
Her grandma must be very proud of herThis is what the real definition of people is.
Dont know why his got recommended to me but Im glad it did. Video is filmed beautifully and I think Ive fallen in love with the lady in the video.
how many skills do u haveliziqi  yes
All that education and degrees cant match level of skills she have
WOW and here I am complaining about putting together some furniture from Ikea smh.
When your waifu power is at max level
There is a saying poverty limits peoples imagination. After watching Li Ziqis video, I think laziness also limits peoples imagination. I never imagined a young beautiful girl could do so much by herself ....
I saw an interview with her where she mentioned that her grandfather made furniture and taught her all about it when she was younger. Its wonderful to see that she keeps the tradition.
RESPECT  Also I think its literally the first time in ages YouTube recommended something Actually good to me.
She should come together with al these people who make the underground pools with sticks and build and entire country
Chinese IKEA proverb Use machete instead of Allen key.
Very strong girl, those bamboos weigh a lot
She makes me feel proud of being a woman. Her skills impress me always. A true diamond.  
I never seen a strong, beautiful and creative woman like her Shes amazing Edit  likes ThanksEdit  likesArigatgozaimashita

Wow She is cute,pretty,strong and self dependent woman. And She is a real example of beauty with brain...
Wth everything around that place feels so magical
This is one of the most comfy videos I have ever seen.
this is people that live to the s years , healthy calm life
I love the granny. Shes cute. Reminds me of my grandma who passed away in Feb of . Grandma, youre always in my heart.
she deserves more fame than all the celebrities and instagrammers chasing after it.
Bamboo is heavy AF..She looks skinny but pretty sure shes actually muscular
I am a Hawaiian born Japanese woman who practices traditional Chinese medicine and you have once again made me fall in love with Chinese culture  I didnt know mugwort could be used as a filler for cushions  I wonder how it must smell.  I also loved the technique you used to bend bamboo.  It looks beautiful in its green state, but Im guessing it will age into a nice beige color.  It totally looked as if you had done this before.  Your tools were so specific and your movements were so deliberate and efficient
Every move she makes is dripping in confidenceAt first I was jealous because of all the cool things she can do and build and all the knowledge she must possess but I realize its her confidence and sureness I wish I hadShes amazing
Being a women I am very much inspired by her dedication hard work calmness  and simplicity........she is a great inspiration to people all over  world especially to the women....
In this cruel world, I didnt knew that such peaceful life exists.
........... 
Hard working woman and clearly extremely smart beautiful

i love her, shes so wonderful. 
I love to watch you at work, youre amazing, and so creative, artistic, intelligent and a strong person for doing all that you do daily and still so calm, and taking care of your Grandma, also making sure you prepare meals for her too .  I find that I can be able to not stress and relax, reminds me of my country life...which I left  years ago., but all the more interesting to see how much you can do.
How can you do all this things so perfectly .. Really impressed 
Next thing you know she gonna make a rocket from stuff she can find in the backyard and go to space in it 
Parabns , aja pacincia pra fazer o que vc faz ... Muito bonito

CongratulationThis video get ,, thumbs up I am waiting for the day long time .Finally coming.No other person can reach this goal.,,
Having friends from other cultures makes me more creative. In fresh ways about space and how people create their own world and environment. It is best way to connect between creative thinking and crosscultural relationships
       ,  

I cant even make my bed right LOLI gotta step up my game  shes incredible
 .     
Im the only one who thinks ithahawas very cute
im thinking of making  a bed frame with bamboo. i wanna make the way you make it. without machinery. all by hand. if only everyone could live like this, having to make everything on your own. instead of going to the grocery store for veggies for example you grow them. it the work that makes it rewarding and understanding what life was like back then  before us. im so proud of you, it so hard i know, but it amazing seeing what goes on to give your family comfort, food, clothes, but more importantly doing this because you want to. remember, only do what you feel is happy for yourself and insure you can eat, drink, rest especially, but also have time for yourself.  Make sure you care for yourself, do not over do it, it will affect your health.
she is the most talented person i have ever watched on this platform. 
I like how feminine and strong and disciplined she is gin d
No tengo ni la mas palida idea, de que fue lo que dijo en el titulo v

Thank you for sharing your expert skills and beautiful furniture.
I wonder how many cuts shes suffered through her lifetime to reach such level of patience and artistry
  
OK this lady has some serious skills up her sleeve, many generations of knowledge and hard labour passed down through family to end up with this beautiful garden of eden,I hope she has children to pass this priceless knowledge to next generation.
Me Watching her cleverly cut and bend bamboo... Well, would you look at that I think I said it thirteen times throughout this video. She held the bamboo steady with her foot while cutting. I would have managed to slice off my own leg while simultaneously cutting the wrong spot on the bamboo.
Give this lady some rocket fuel and shell be the first woman to land on the moon.
Lowkey ASMR EditYes
I dont even deserve to marry one like her shes way out of my league
This feels like if HBO did a mini movie. Very well done
Shooting and editing is very powerful
ww nice work She worked more than a week for this video and what she got k dislikes People who disliked this video eather they are jealous or they are just stupid
I once assembled an IKEA desk and bookshelf. I thought that was an accomplishment.
She never ask to subscribe n share ..to press bell icon and all.... But her vedio is Sooo beautiful ...natural ...peaceful.. By watching her vedio we feel so blessed happy n Bliss... She dont have to request for anything.... Automatically lots of people are subscribing n watching.

wife honey, i like a new set of furniture from IKEA.  husband watch this video.
She is really something. Amazing skills.
IKEA makes complicated Furniturethe Chinese Girl imma end this Companys Career
ok what CANT this lady do  legend
I am so glad I stopped to watch this.  Makers are truly the same all over the world their imagination, perseverance and craftsmanship is so satisfying to watch and the filmmaking and storytelling is also superb.  Bamboo looks like such an amazing material  I wish I had a forest to gather my materials from.  The only place I could ever find it when I was young was behind the carpet stores the carpet was rolled on bamboo.  Today they just use paper or plastic or metal  I dont know where one would find large bamboo in America for a project like this.  I did not know it could be heatbent  something new I learned from this video.  And my many thanks for the kind soul who provided the translation.  I will surely smile every time I remember this video.
I wanna live that kind of life
Me at  am gotta sleep, exam at  am tomorrow...Brain  yo dude how about we learned how to make bamboo sofa instead...
WE KNOW SHE DONT LIVE ALONE IN A ISOLATE PLACE  WITH HER GRAND MOTHER... THIS IS ALL MADE FOR YOUTUBE
Chinese civilization is great, and the Chinese people have preserved their ancient heritage over time, a people that deserves all respect
her grandmother must be so proud
that little aha when she walked on top of the bench  so cute 
This is proof that EVERYTHING in this world comes from Mother Nature.

Next season of SurvivorTeam Gonnalose Ok guys, weve made these makeshift tents, lets get started on a campfire.Team Liziqi Ive made a  story hotel with working plumbing,  threadcount embroidered sheets in every room and a star gourmet restaurant just off the lobby, where I am the head Master Chef and sole proprietor.Team Gonnalose .... butTeam Liziqi And yes, there is a complimentary continental breakfast tomorrow.Team Gonnalose Were... gonna lose.
Who needs IKEA when you have a whole bamboo forest in your back yard, and can get matching furniture.
Damn, Youtube recommendations are getting hella good recently.Really serene and puts the mind at peace. Truly awesome.
  .....
Whos still watching this wonderful set in  
Some people still dont know who she is. They said she is paid actress.. come on guys.. look at her hand.. thats worker hands, not an actress hand.. 
If I am in wasteland, I will call all of us, grab her, and let her be our female leader. She will lead us to rebuild human civilization.

I need a woman like that she is very very special
I cant believe she did this without wearing gloves. The splinters
......
Damn, not only did she make her own furniture, but she also embroidered her pillows and sheets. And here I have a hard time understanding the instructions for an Ikea product.
Damn This girl can do everything  is she a human hahaha.
What cant this young lady do The Chinese culture is so beautiful.
Its mesmerizing to watch her confident skill, knowledge of materials, industriousness, artistic sensibility, versatility  imagination.She sets the high standard for being a person of substance  virtue. We can all learn a great deal from her by the pleasure she derives from simplicity  the fruits of her own labors.I, for one, am rethinking my own value system.
Grandma I like the chair on my neighbors house.Liziqi say no more
Strong independent woman without feminist personality.Waifu material at its best
Beautiful, skilled, strong, and compassionate... Whats not to like.
, people disliked this. Excuse me, what Its literally a person making a sofa out of bamboo.
   .

A tight slap to those girls who says that dancing and doing makeup all day is feminism..
Fak, she puts me and most ppl I know to shame by her skills... This is a wife to get, if we are having some kind of apocalypse, survival is highly likely with her 
   .  ,  .  , ,  .
Sometimes when you see her hands from a close up looks like mens hands. I think that it looks like a production. Who filmed her Who edit She has different social media platforms, so is this real Does she really do her make up
She can literally make a whole living and Im here starting off and accidentally getting scratches and cry in pain
I saw it and l loved it
Imagine being her neighbor and hearing the sounds of slashing at night and sharpening a knife.
Malayalees undo
She looks like a freaking princess. A hardworking one. Wow.
I almost cry. I remember that my family had a bamboo sofa just like the one that Li Ziqi made when I was a kid. I loved it very much and it was so cool and refreshing to sleep on. With the development of technology and economy in China, we did not need it anymore since weve had air conditioners and fans everywhere, so one day when it was  years ago or so my granny decided to throw it away. I cried and begged her not to do that. She asked meHow would you deal with this big thing It takes up too much space. I didnt know how to answer her. She threw it away two days later... I will always remember the bamboo sofa that accompanied my family for decades, and all the precious things disappeared in the modern society.
And heres my sister, who doesnt know how to fold bedsheet
Bamboo, is one of four plant treasures in chinese cultural traditions. It is strong , bend with the wind and does not break easily. It stays green in all four seasons. It has endless uses and applications in chinese daily life. What this girl did with bamboo is the embodiment of its treasury in chinese culture.

Seriously I could just watch her all day, skilled and beautiful.
This amazing woman is very proud of her culture and  traditions she is amazing
I love how she did not use metal nails in the furniture.
Im about to turn . And I finally figured out, I want to be just like her.
Granny do you think this nuclear power station I built is good Wah, so nice Hehe
For those who question her, Ziqi was abandoned by her parents when she was born. She was adopted by a women but was not well treated. Her grandparents finally took care of her however they are old. Ziqi grew up alone and left home when she was . She did many jobs to survive and learned so many things she was even a DJ at some time. Life is tough for her but she never gave up. However her grandmother was seriously sick so she decided to go back home and took care of her. Luckily, her record of her life made her famous and gave her a better life. What a tough girl
i see beautiful woman make furniture out of bamboo, i click, and immediately press like button, and subscribe.i dont know but i like something out of bamboo. and it is nice to see this video on recommendation
 THOUSAND dislikes Why

After doin all the hardwork she looks so calm,I sense the feeling of satisfaction....I mean ,how can she be so strong and extremely talented in everything she doesUNBELIEVABLE THIS GIRL,just unbelievable.......I wonder how....
Her hometown in Sichuan, which is also the hometown for pandas. lol
Not many people can appreciate living like this.i was born in a.rain Forest, this is how we made our beds
Wow... She just made a set of beautiful furniture in no time and in very skillful manner. I would have probably already died on the way to the forest to get the bamboo, mauled by a pissed off panda or something.
Im scared of the dark when I sleep.. but when I watch her on my bed in the dark.. I feel safe for some reason
First time I feel like, didnt waste  minutes in YouTube. Nice work...
She is so beautiful as well as all her magnificent works ....

This girl does not need IKEA. IKEA needs her.
Amazing talented work that should be continually passed down to future generations, so that the beauty and skills of this art are NEVER lost with time. That was a lot of hard work, but truly a stunning outcome.
The beauty inside her flows into everything she does.
SpeechlessNo words can describe you liziqiWish you a happy long life
Im not certain as to why this popped up on my recommend, however I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.
She looks beautiful assembling a piece of furniture that she completely sourced from the forest.  Meanwhile I look like crap assembling premade furniture from Ikea.
I was planning on being productive today.  YouTube recommendations had other plans...
I am in love with this woman. All respect

I finally understand why traditional Chinese girls are so attractive.
All the thumbs down votes must have very sad lifes.
This is an insanely beautiful video I didnt know bamboo was so good to work with...
Shes beautiful and does work with pride. Need more people like that.
Im alway waiting for her videos like a kid waiting for a candy  
Man, Whoever marrying her is the luckiest guy in the world.
Little woman but shes strong  can do everything 
May the God bless her mightily and fulfill all her needs
Her knows how to make furniture out of bamboo.Me can barely make my bed.
The fact that you can do all these things and make it look effortless with grace is beyond me. Youre amazing 
I clicked because the girl in the thumbnail looked so pretty and familiar to me. Idk her, but she is so impressive. Strong and beautiful woman.

ancient Chinese people almostly didnt trade because like this way they could make things themselvessuch an example
Bamboo is amazing. Lets utilize it in every way that we can.
Im so glad youtube recommended me this girl 
Lei  molto brava signorina
Im sure she knows KungFu .. I just know it
I dont get why there are disliking.... I mean I cant even carry one bamboo , and I bet the people who dislike it cant either .
beauty, talent, courage,hardworking women everything that a man could imagine of is in her
That is one smart, tough, wonderful, and beautiful young lady.  I gave up my mancard to her a long time ago, when I watched her make an awesome outdoor swingloungelove seatbed.   Those are some really nice furniture pieces I want to take a nap on the lounge so bad...   Thank you, , so much for your wonderful videos. Best wishes.
There are no words to express my feelings right now. She is a superhuman.

SHE MADE A FRICKIN PILLOW FOR THE DOG, THIS WOMAN IS A GODDESS
The old traditional tools she uses for making mattress from cottons are very rare nowadays in China, but they werequite common in old rural China households. I dont think you can find any of those tools in other countries.
Your life style is just like a poem and a beautiful song.
Lets sign a petition to Disney to make a princess character inspired from her who doesnt need a prince charming for her survival. This will be a massive hit
The life of is a great way to begin the title your videos

Me after  mins of this video I wanna go live with her and do all these thingsMe at the end of video realises Im a lazy ass
Shes the Duvet Cover Queen, a lot of love went into the making of that Duvet Blanket, Grandmother taught her well
watching her do all those things makes me feel like a useless and lazy human being.
i simply adore these videos of this wonderful women doing all the tasks as she would have  years ago the food and building basic structure is so awesome much Ahroha LOVE From NEW ZEALAND
She always thinks about others before her even if it is a animal.
This life is more beautiful than standing at the phone all day and having no friends
Can you imagine how long this  minutes vid take her to film damn impressed
Incredible how she does everything with love.  She has a good heart.  Increble como hace todo con amor.  Ella tiene buen corazn.
I died at the part where the dog cuddled into the blanket she made for them it was so cute 
I want to go there with your place so I can learn even how to plant and live with my own sweat just like you always shown in your video.
  ,     
Anybody else get tearyeyed when she gave her dog a doggy bed I love her so much. She doesnt know me but I love her and I wish many good fortunes to follow and bless her and her family.
She knows a lot about chinese and she is also very beautiful she create videos about her making things and thats really great. She makes clothes, foods and more for the grandparents.
I actually have a cotton stuffed blanket that is made that exact same way. When you take it out of its casing you can see all the crisscrossing threads. Its super warm and somehow still breathable. My parents and I brought it with us when we immigrated to Canada  years ago and its served me well for many, many winters across multiple provinces.
        
How is it possible to dislike someone who is working so hard  Its such a peaceful life shes living.

What a wonderful woman I never seen in this world. Shes busy every minute
Giving the dog a blanket was the loveliest part. My heart melted.
What a cute dog. The original way of life feels beautiful.
I wonder how often does she make a mattress I mean, for her to remember the delicate details, its amazing. I do the same things daily n still manage to forget this n that
Im amazed...I honestly have no words.
I think some people might think, Why is she spending so much time doing that, when she can just buy it The point is sometimes making something yourself and living a simple life with the feeling of having all the time in the world is actually a luxury. Its like doing a puzzle or meditating, except you get to enjoy the end result. 

How does she stay so clean Whenever I work in the garden I look like an actual pig.
She has a good land. She is so hard working. She can do all these magical things like a disney princess.God bless her
watching her do all those things makes me feel like a useless and lazy human being.
What a calm loving show and goddesses. Education of Gaia growth abilities.
Soubhanallah from a cotton to a blanket. Imagine if everyone do this in his garden, we can reduce the pollution of their factories. Please, we can all change the world, as a  teenager, last year I planted some beans, tomatoes, but they died, but the avocado and the pine tree are growing, I hope inchallah our garden will be the best. And why Because the climate changing motivated me.Hope peoples will change 
I just love how she has such a large overview of time, to be able to film things weeks, months and, sometimes, years ahead just so she can put them togther at the end.Makes me wonder what marvels she has in her video vault just waiting for the right time to finish and share with us lucky folk.
Estou encantada com os vdeos. So muito inspiradores. Vejo a Glria do Senhor em cada planta, s sementes germinando....coisa linda. Parabns
This is incredible  What an amazing way of living. Beautiful skill.
Li Ziqi grows cotton, mends cotton tools, makes bedding so Grandma can rest comfortably. Even the pup gets a bed. So talented, so nice 
Beautifully created and with such generosity too xx sending hugs and much love across the water to you 
It didnt hit me until I saw her lay the cotton mattress on her grandmothers bed, she worked so hard for so many hours so many days into the night tirelessly weaving and sewing to make a cozy warm mattress for her grandmother and it brought me to tears how selfless and hardworking she really is and how I wish I could be like that
I love your videos, and its very comfortable to watch them, youre very strong and peaceful, thanks for showing and share with us.
The fact she took the time to also make one for the pupper... she gets an instant get into heaven card. What a classy lady. This is what I call class. Not dolled up, not trying hard to be something shes not, providing, caring. Beautiful inside and out. Class act.

Americans the Chinese eat cats and dogs They hate animalsLi Zi Qi makes a cotton bed from raw materials for her pup so he wouldnt be cold
    .   ,     .
I still have this childhood memory of my mom taking our cotton beddings to the craftsmans workshop and let them add more layers. I can still visualize their movements of doing it.  Thats how we survived the humid and severe winter with no heat in central China. Now my hometown is urbanized so fast and those workshops are nowhere to see, our beddings have come from these old schooled cotton to modern mattress. Thank you Liziqi for her beautiful skills to reperform traditional agricultural life style. Its a memory we Asians, as well as humans share together. Its a history we shall respect and not being oblivious of.
Im from chengdu, China.Liziqi and I are km apart, we are both the same age, the content in her video is all the real things that we can get in touch with when we were young, but it takes too much time to make. In China, most people born in the s have such experience, and she reminds me all the time how incompetent I amHa ha haYou are the pride of sichuan and China
You are so amazing, you can do all things perfectly, love your skills and commitment.The life of cotton well demonstrated.Love it.
Wow imagine having talent and knowledge
This lady grew the damn cotton picked it, processed it, fluffed it, weaved a net for it, and stuffed inside all to make a new mattress for her grandmother and her dogs to sleep comfortably.  My god this woman is amazing
She is a talented woman, yes. But she also has a Huge heart.
 
The time when she rubbed and relaxed her wrist ..I felt that pain God bless her

Please dont change the name of the series I love it
This channel is the best accident that ever happened to me.
one of the reallife Mulan in this world...
Translation from Liziqis comments
Its OneLife series again. It means a long time spanStarted at about April th, .






 




When I was a child, I often saw cotton growing in the field near my house. But I dont see it when I grew up.At that time, there was a big drying dam beside the house, and there was a nearly   cotton field beside the drying dam.Cotton blossomed beautifully, with white and pink flowers swaying in the wind. I enjoyed flowers in the cotton field, and I felt that Im beautiful too, and I thought I havent changed that till now . 







For memorizing, I planed to grow cotton, and then I bought cotton seeds online.I bought several types of cotton because I was afraid that some of them may not suitable for growing in this climate.Fortunately, cotton blossomed later.But later, I was busy with other things during the transplanting period, which led to the poor growth of cotton. Finally, and fortunately, there is also a little harvest. Not so much...










The picked cotton should be dried to remove water vapor and then be seeded.When I was a child, I saw a special machine for removing cottonseed, but now it is gone, so I could only remove impurities by hand.If you pick one by one by hand, you cant finish it until the Spring Festival. Then I figured out a way to comb the cotton seeds with a wool comb. Its slower than a machina, but its much faster than a manual summary.It took about half a day to finish kg of cotton.









First of all, fix the cotton thread, and then start to strike cotton....... The description of making process, its hard to translate Im sorry...


 
This tool is about  years old, and no one has used it for a long time.The wood is weathered, and the bamboo bars are almost broken.



I spent a lot of time repairing this tool, during which my nose was hurt because of the flying bamboo stick when I cut the bamboo.  Finally, it was polished and could be continued to be used with new tendon strings.



But, remember that the cotton can only be fluff after it is loosened with a stick, because the cotton is too tight to be easily bounced off and will be wrapped on the string. And getting tighter and tighter...










Fluffing cotton is really hard work Its no exaggeration to say that its more difficult to do this than to carry tens of kilograms of grain on my back. When I was a child, I surrounded my uncle every day to see him fluff cotton. But I didnt operate it myself.This time, I wanted to operate it myself. I learned two days in advance, and want to make a quilt for my grandma.Its too hard Because the wood is more than  kg, and I have to hit the string hard, and to keep balance while Im fluffing cotton.By the way, If you can find such a old machina, you can try it yourself.
Although the quilt made by the machine is nice and warm now, I want to make a quilt for my grandma by myself.When she heard that I was going to make her a quilt, she was so happy.
At that time, when I was fluffing cotton, she was always around me and said she wanted to help me hahaha.
I think it was very meaningful


Finally, I made a quilt for Guozainame of the dog, because there was no special quilt before, only an old cotton padded jacket for her.
Now its time to make a new quilt for Guozai.



So...Its very cold these days  I hope you keep warm. And take good care of yourselves Love youtranslated from Liziqis comments in Bilibili

I hope shes okay, with everything going on in China right now. Be safe, we love you
 meraviglioso guardarti.. love from italy
She lost her parents when we was kid and lived with her grandmother till now, lots people was questioning how she manage life looks so easy, here is the answer  she was doing it when she was kid and choose live with grandma now because she is her only loved once, Im Chinese so i have read her background.
Honestly the biggest respecc moment is she has to be like filming her everyday life, most of it, for a long time so you just get a lot of footage sitting around. and then she has to compile and pull together probably hours or footage from over like half a year into one video, and continue to do that consistently for different topics. shit really do add up yo, everyday you dont see progress and its just a bunch of small things but at the end you really do get a bigass harvest. and thats how shes compiling these vids. mad respecc.
Qu Maravilloso video, un ejemplo de dedicacin y trabajo. FELICIDADES A ESA MUJER EJENPLAR 
How nice the little guilt she made for her little dog. I would a new guilt for you as the CNY it is approaching, she said to the dog, and she made one for her. Wish I could be the dog under that nice guilt in her home   Tan Mian Hua Fluffing cotton, is a job in which has been fading out in China. It was a skillful job conducted by the strong  and skillful men. The instruments includes an about m long wooded stick, an about .m long bamboo bend with a  .m depends  string normally made of a refined leather because of elastic and tenacious  and a wooden club. The worker has a belt on his waist and the one side of the stick through on the back.The bamboo bend is hocked on the another side of the stick and the left hand hold the bend with the string down. How to work left hand hold the bend with string move back and forth, up and down to the cotton, meanwhile the right holds the wooden club keeping playing the string. The string jumping like spring upanddown on the cotton of which the way to fluff the cotton from the big mass into a piece of feather.    It mainly operates in the countryside, some people had no piece no land or some of them had poor economy from the land, whatever the reasons. The work literally documents in Yuan dynasty  which means the existence long before that. In the past, the demand of fluffing cotton normally occurred in the later autumn or winter because the farming were done and people became to prepare something for their families, new cloth, shoes and new guilt. That was the season for fluffing cotton to make something. At that moment of planned economy, very few people would be able pay for cash. Many of them paid with grains, a piece of meat, or half fish or some eggs or some sugar....Nowadays, it has totally gone from many Chinese peoples life as we are at the industrialization. Ziqis video gives us a study of common knowledge from a seed of cotton of how the cotton grows up and what does it looks like and the way of cotton have become a guilt. It is an education. It does not warm her granny, her dog and it warms us, the audiences of the world. Thank you very much, Ziqi for sharing with us.  Happy Chinese New Year. All the best for the descriptions it is . million jumping over  billion in the year of Rat 
I like how this is the only place where one nationality or one race isnt screaming at another, pointing fingers and spreading more hate. This channel is full of people with compassion and love, lets keep supporting each other like this and stay safe everyone

SUCH A PHENOMENAL YOUNG LADY AND ELDER THAT TAUGHT HER EVERYTHING SHE KNOWS THE TIME THE ELDERS SPENT TEACHING HER IS EXACTLY WHAT THE WORLD IS MISSING KNOWLEDGE HANDED DOWN TO THE YOUTH BY THE ELDERS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER AND THE PERSON SHE LEARNED TO BE I WISH WE ALL COULD LIVE LIKE THIS THIS IS HOW IT WAS MEANT TO BE BY OUR LOVING CREATOR THANK YOU DEAR ONES... FOR SHOWING US HOW LIFE SHOULD BE.... IF ONLY WE COULD JUST SWITCH OVER TO THIS WAY OF LIFE BUT THIS LIFE DOESNT JUST HAPPEN OVERNIGHT... GENERATIONS HAVE BUILT THIS LOVING WAY OVER TIME, THROUGH NURTURING AND HARD WORK WE WORK HARD IN THE HOPES IT WILL BE EASIER IN OUR OLD AGE MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR AMAZING FAMILY MIS LIZ, IN THE HOLY NAME OF JESUS, BE BLESSED AMEN.
Shes very patient and spontaneous. This video must take at least a year to make from seedling to harvesting and sewing.
This was amazing and such hard work Was hoping to see how cotton balls are converted into threads without machine though.
Shes so good Jack of all trade.Love the way she took good care of her dog
You are absolutely amazing, God bless you.
This woman has infinitely more patience, skill, and selflessness than everyone I have ever met combined. She did that all for her grandmother and her dog
I am so proud to see inspiring videos like this.
I swear one of her videos show up on your trending and then the next thing you know youre on a marathon
I pray the coronavirus doesnt touch her or her grandmotherEDIT Calm down, people. I didnt mean to start a war
  
Imagine if school taught us all the things she knew, we would be well off and able to live comfortably.  We would be able to do everything ourselves and wouldnt be damaging the planet much at all
Her hands shows how hard working she is. A truly living goddess away from this digital and hectic world of ours. I hope she can live forever and create more amazing videos like this so the next generations can also see how beautiful life lived in place without fast cars and towering buildings. May God bless her always. .
shes such an inspiration. I was about to cry when I realised she was making this for her grandmother and then for the dog... 
This channel is the best accident that ever happened to me.

We will always support u.
My goodness, Li you remind me about  years  ago in Tehran and my grandma was bringing a cotton cover maker at home in very early in the morning till sun down .He was using the same instrument you used to open the cotton balls and then he was swing all over the cover , beautiful motifs in traditional Iranian shapes . Thank you so much for your sweet and educational work . You always bring me back to my childhood . All my family specially my grand children love you and admire you . With love from New York 
I feel so sad your hard work
I almost started to cry when, even after all that hard work for her Grannys bed and she must have been exhausted, Ziqi took the time to make that beautiful little bedcover for her dog
I think her grandma is the luckiest grandma in this whole world ...
Hello Lijiqi... I am from Bangladesh. My wife told me about your video. Yes   Its really feel great to see how you spend your life without technology. Lots of good wishes from Bangladesh

Once upon a time, there lived a princess named   Liziqi. I was inspired by her to film my mother for my channel...
Dont change the name of the series,  its perfect as it is. You named it and let it stays that way.  If people dont like it,  thats their problem. Lot of love.
      ,

She spent two years for only this  mins, love those who respect their life and work, by the way I miss my home town Guilin very much I cant wait to go back
Im sorry but why  k of dislike U there at home watching this video are u able to do  of what she does Thats not fair, the hard work she put on it.
Is no one gonna bring up the adorable puppies Especially the one at the end
The grandma must be so happy that she raised such a good granddaughter 
up
Shes what everyone Woman inspires to be. Truly a hard working , independent, and smart woman.
Grandma I think I need a softer bedHer let me grow cotton and see what I can doShe is the definition of self sufficient 
She makes me  wanna live on a far away mountain but then I remember I aint got skills like her lol
Love you lots dear sister liziqiI am an Indian. But you inspired me lots.
How can people dislike this This is pure elegance and life simplicity.
Anyone feels peaceful when watch her videosHer videos can help to take away the stress of life. Love from Singapore 
Her way of starting seed was really interesting.  Shes almost like a historical record of traditional techniques.
Hermoso trabajo, podra verte todo el da. Mi corazn se emociona con la sonrisa de tu abuelita.
Definitely the richest person in youtube. Rich of cultureRich of naturRich of personalityRich of hardworkRich of love
She is Amazing... Take me right to my childhood in Argentina. And I was the happiest person on earth. Nothing better than been connected to mother Gaia and know how to live anywhere. I love her. God bless her for inspires so many peoples.
After watching her videos, suddenly Im doing what I do with more conviction.  If not, its easy to procrastinate and not have the motivation to really do everyday living stuff with a sense of accomplishment.
I hope you guys can have a look at my words.As far as I know, Liziqi has been trying her best to find channels for materials these days. So far, at least , medical masks, , pairs of medical gloves and  protective clothing have been donated by LiziqiShe is too tired, so she has no mood and energy to update the videos. I hope you guys can understand her. Up to now, the coronavirus has been clearly controlled, the number has been declining continuously, and it is expected to be completely solved in March.Pay homage to Liziqi and all the virus fighters
Me need bed go buyLiziqi plant cotton seeds

I love the red sweater with hearts that the granny wears. 
Is there anything this lady cannot make  She is so amazing.  Her grandparents taught her well.
She is the strongest woman that i have ever seen with multi skills from the engineer, landscaper and chef. BIG love from me.
this is the girl we all dreamed to be as a child.
                         
I actually teared up when you made her dog a mini comforter.
VERY TALENTED AND CARING PERSON, NICE VLOG. I ALSO WATCH Mandeepvlogs JalandharHaweli SUPER NICE VLOGS ABOUT PUNJABI CULTURE BY A VERY TALENTED, HARD WORKING AND PLEASANT PERSON
I wish there was a love button. It was so heartwarming when she made the cotton mattress topper for her grandma and then she even made a blanket for the dog 
Looks like her grandpa  when was alive taught her much, respect for her grandpa  n grandma who raised her w love n care ...n she is good granddaughter also.. Btw I love look her cute puppies 
I love her, she is such a hardworking and brave woman that can do almost everything,please support her more especially now since there are lots of bad comments about  her. Also loved how she purposely made the dog a nicer and cozier blanket... So sweet
Omg..the description she didnt had a good harvest but shes grateful to have enought to make mattress for her granny
PLEASE be careful outside, may you and your entire community be safe from the virus
When she made the blanket for the dog 
I cry to see how she love her grandma and her pets 

She is very hard working girl. I am totally impressed. Very good
Thats what I love about China. Wow
I love that she took time to make bed for her dog. That was jus lovely 
She appreciates all the beauty and love surrounding her. Thats why she makes heaven a living reality. And plus, shes so skillful and resourceful, not to mention, also so beautiful. I just admire her so much.
What an amazing woman Why the dislikes There should be zero dislikes for all she does The ending was adorable Love watching all of your videos
this makes me realize how much stress we live under. with school, drama, friends, grades, just go outside for a little and weave yourself a flower crown. breath. the world may do many things to you, but if you can appreciate what the world does best, it will give it to you. all we worry about is the drama, the grades, the work, the pressure, the trying to be best at something thingy, but deep down we dont depend on that to survive. look around, and whenever you feel discouraged or left out, just try something new. breath in and out, in and out. appreciate what the world has given you.
I can only wish to have even just an inch of her skills.
That must have taken  years to make
When she tucked her puppy in, I remembered when I used to tuck my dog in every night and kiss her to bed. But she passed away in April. Ill love her til death. Hugs from Italy 
Dear Li LaoshiWe are all hoping and praying for you and your grandmother and everyone else in China to be safe and healthy in this new year.
ziqi  is okay ,dont worry, because of the virus ,ziqi stop updating, she is working on donation now for the virus ,  as you know , the most important thing in china now is fighting the virus ,  she will update soon ,
Just when you think youve seen everything,  she suprises you with a new talent.  This lady is full of  love and great talents. She deserves all the kindness and love in return  from Canada
I pray that everything will be okay with her and her granny during this darkest time in China. Been waiting for her video but thats okay her and her grannys safety is priority. Lets pray she and her granny is fine.
I wish wed been taught useful stuff like this when we were growing up, in school  instead of having to sit through hours of useless crap, in which we had no interest. With skills like this one is independent, selfreliant.This is why they dont teach it in schools.
She is a very talented and hardworking girl with a big heart in loving and caring for people and animal around her  Alway look forward to her new video
     .    .
One of strongest feelings I have when watching Ziqis videos is this life style can become a therapy for depression. One gets too busy for depression and every outcome becomes rewarding and appreciated. After following her series, I myself became more diligent, and complaining less about daily chores and labor. Thank you Ziqi

She is soooooo crazy Clever girl and the part that it makes her Stand out in my own Opinion is, her love for her grandmother.  This Alone will Lead her to more Blessing in her life ahead. Great gift for a Grandmother. Is a LOVING granddaughter .
Long cu mnh thch xem thank you hi
She is quite famous now. And she always donates a lot of money to schools.
She just made a mattress without using any technology and with her bare hand. I stan.
Im impressed My lazy butt laying in bed breathing hard like I was the one doing all that hard word...
If you want something to be good, make it yourself
Shes not just can do everything, but shes professional in EVERYTHING.

Wow your dp so pretty gorgeous yrr 
Me I bought this tshirt fabric and hand sewed the entire dress. Liziqi you bought the fabric lol thats cute.
R u okay  We are there for you...We miss you I hope everything is going alright.Stay healthy and stay away from virus crowded areas  .
Noticed her nails that are filled with mud, they may not be the prettiest nails with the greatest nailart but they belong to the most wonderful woman in the world
No one can hate this girl. She has a wonderful talent. And everyone should be grateful about that talent. Even their own talent.
OMG u have so much of patience
She is like that beautiful princess like lady of fairytales who is so loving, strong, golden hearted, hardworking and amazing. I love her so much.
No international  brand can give this pure cotton cloth....
,
omg, her patience with the string. I would be so annoyed after an hour.
Damn. She is the one who should be the actress for Mulan.
Eric Li
OMG...she just stole my heart, taking care of her grandmother and then the way she careful made and put the blanket around the old dog....thank you for sharing 
All the people who disliked this video are the problem with this world. No appreciation for anything. I am thoroughly impressed with her handmaking skills. Very interesting and beautiful.
Omg she made a blanket for the dog because it was cold


I love how that vase is always filled with what she brings inside her home. Flowers in makeup video..and now cotton. It feels symbolic,.....and also gentle. Like time shown in a frame, slowly but surely changing, little by little. Its peaceful...

      
Who wants to watch her videos every day like me

This young lady is fascinating, her skill at some of the ancient ways of living life, making her clothing, making her own furniture, her incredible gardens, and her total devotion to her grandmother.  She is obviously super intelligent, hardworking, caring, and to top it off she is beautiful. Always waiting for her next video.
My cute Youtuber Lizipi...
She does all this work yet still manages to look like a princess.
She kinda reminds me of mulan. Like she is an independent girl who can achieve many things
Me I need a new blanket going to IkeaLizqi hold my machete
The most awsome woman in this crazy world. Take care

Oh..lord how much patience is needed for this.She is a Miracle

This is the most industrious woman Ive ever seen.
The reason why she has long time no updating, is because her grandma is sick, so she needs to take good care of her grandma first. Also, she is recovering and taking a long break, make sure everything fine, hopefully her grandma get well soon and she might be back in few days 
Shed be the only person to survive in the apocalypse
  
     
I feels so useless right now. That is one hell of a woman. Damn
Who r liking to stay in this place
I know, i know, some of you are just too mesmerized by her and not watching what shes doing. For me, I needed to watch the video mulitple times. st time in awe, have never seen anything like this before mouth wide open. nd time, i begin to notice the span of time this project took  the change of seasons, and change in her clothings. rd time, i studied her contraptions, which are worn and needed repair. So i deduced she does not do this project often, or at least not recently. Yet why is she so good at it She works on everything with such confident gusto. I floss my teeth everyday for yrs and have not figured out what length to use. th time, i re watched my favorite parts  grandma, and the puppies th time, i truely appreciated the cinematography of this entire video  always remembering that shes not only the actor, shes the producing and editor. How she anticipates when to zoom in and out, even for the same scene, plus aerial view, and sound mix between ambient and music, and always giving viewers and unexpected sec of heartwarming treats at the end. Science and art beautifully woven. Well done, LZQ Thank you
   

When you cant even make your own bed and she is literally MAKING HER OWN BED...my mother may be ashamed of me XD
I love how she just handed the puppy to the grandmother I dunno I found that so cute 
Isnt great she love grandmother a lot She wants a soft bed and she made for her Hats of this girl She also love her animals a lot She is so telanted Absoulty incridable
Liziqi uploaded a videoMe cancel everything
She is such a responsible girl. I really appreciate her for all the works she hav done. She is great
Liziqi  Just wanted to send my best wishes.  I hope that all of you are safe from the corona virus.  My heart and prayers are with the Chinese people, and all the others suffering from this.  Much love and respect from the USA.
Petition for Liziqi to make a grand tour
I am sure I am not the only one who genuinely wishes that Liziqui was my next door neighbour and best friend. Her caring nature for everyone and everything around her knows no boundaries, and her desire to learn and acquire so many ancient crafts which all too easily could be lost in the modern world is endless. The sheer time and effort which Liziqui goes to when completing all these tasks is beyond astounding. A beautiful young woman with an abundance of talent and a whole encyclopaedia of knowledge. The western world has much to learn from this precious soul.
 that womam is incredibily capable, I want one like she 
I will never look at my cotton quilts the same way again, so much work to make one although mine must be made by machines, Still, it makes me appreciate this daily stuff much more now. Thanks for the education, ZiQi 
Thinking of all the Chinese people at this frightening time. Lizique, Grannie and friends stay safe and well. Love from another Grannie in Scotland

Me scrubbing my face with cotton while watching.Melook at the cotton in my hand each cotton has its own story.
Im extremely impressed by her . Shes the most hard working woman Ive ever seen such a proud
All the dislikes are from people that buy lemon juice in the bottle because they cant even squeeze it themselves.
Love from india 
Now, some people accuse Ziqi,s  videos of being fake and too far away from real life. But think about it. We know for a fact that Star Wars is fake, we know Superman is fake, we know pretty much all movies are fake in that regard. But it doesnt stop us from enjoying a good movie. Li Ziqi is extremely creative. She presents everything with an artistic touch, and the end result is simply amazing. Is it exactly how she lives her life now Maybe not. But even if its a dream, its a beautiful dream built on real life.

She is the kind of girl that can make a home comfortable, and secure.
Liziqi 
Her hand was hurt while making the mattress but she continued weaving for her grandmother. I wish to achieve such high level of dedication.
     
This women is really ausome
I cried at the end when she made a blanket for the puppy.
Me I want a cotton blanket Li ZiQi You need to start planting cotton trees first
She is really a genius. When I was a child I saw professionals touring to towns before every CNY to make quilts like that for families. It is really strength and energy taking as you can see from the video, and Id never seen a woman doing that. Now the skill has disappeared for so many years and she is doing that as a young lady
I love how simple her life is. I feel relaxed watching her videos and it made me realize how toxic office life is. Some of us dreams of living in a luxurious home but her way living is what Ive always wanted
This is a whole new level of make from scratch  lol
Acho que ela come esses cachorros .todo video tem um diferente
Her Grandmothers knowledge is blooming through her.  Sometimes in life you dont achieve your goals but God, Allaah in arabic, helps you achieve them through your offsprings. She is now a global icon.
Creators like her by spending such a length time and puttimg on great effort to make few minutes of video, are making YouTube experience alive. And those puppies gives the extra points to this video. 
goosebumps all over again when I was child Around years ago we used to have such some cotton trees in our field and my grandmother use to do such cotton works but with different toolsmethods.and I remember once I made small kind of tool for her and she used to tell stories about her younger times about  weaving cotton .such a hard work now the technologies has changed a lot in the last decades this make me remember old times my grandmother once againLove From NEPAL tq for your hard work and dedication  li ziqi.
The look on her grandmas face. She must be so proud of her, that she learnt all these traditions and can still do it correctly. Love 
When she cuddles up that puppy and it was so sleepy and cute. Heartmelting
 ,  ...
I pray that she, her grandma, and her pets never get hurt or sick. Theyre sweet.
The nine thousands of people who disliked this video shame on you

   ,    .
  .    .
Mom make your bedMe sigh...Liziqi ok, you mean literally right
Why is nobody talking about those cute dogs
Very much adorable when she makes something for her grandma n Tommy as well with her own hands. The way she puts on doggy is so carefully and love Heart feeling.
  
The best part of this is how shes embraced her roots  culture wholeheartedly and unabashedly. If I could Id go back to Sweden, have a farm, some kids and live quietly and simply. For now Ill do my best to replicate that where I am .
Shes making her grandma a mattress.
After watching this and given the fact I have always enjoyed living at the village, helping out my grandparents, growing our own food and herding the livestock. I am going back soon as I complete my studies
       ,      
I just cant figure out, how could a woman like this is real. Every single one of her video is just so soothing, I start to cry when I realize that Im abroad alone and that I miss my country so much... Thank you Li Ziqi, thank you

She is so genius and a hard worker
Fun fact This handcraft stills runs in Li Ziqis family. Thats why she have all basic ingredients and tools using traditional Chinese techniques.
 
she made a whole futon for her grandma and a bed for her dog  if that isnt amazing i dont know what is
Thats what we call  cotton
Liziqis updated informationFor those who are concerning Liziqi, I just saw comments from someone named DHJ see comment section below posted  days ago , heshe has copied Ziqis information from Ziqi assistants Weibo dated on . I translated partially here for your reference. You might use google translator to understand the whole post with all the detailed donation list if you want.According to that information, LiZiqi is busying in finding and sending medical supplies to many hospitals in cities and counties to fight for Coronavirus. According to the data DHJ copied, by  she has donated more than , N face masks, , surgical use face masks, more than , medical use gloves, more than , protective suits, and some goggles and medical disinfection spray etc. She is making sure every express delivery was sent to hospital directly and safely to their hands So she slept very little time during this period, even am still assigned her assistant some tasks. So they are very busy and hope your guys understand.  NNCopy From  httpswww.weibo.comuishot Date  Jan,She is supporting volunteers who are helping in city nearby her hometown. She and her team are doing all their could do to support fighting the virus Thank you for the waiting, caring and wishes Pray for Liziqi, her family, and her team healthy and safe Praying for everyone in the world healthy and safe
This is beautiful
We grow tonnes of cotton, but never once tried something cool. This is the difference between me and this girl. May God bless souls like me to make some wonderful things
Shes a legit disney princess, like Mulan... but of agriculture
Dear Ms. Liziqi, are you fine I wish you and your family well. I am very sorry for the people in your country who have suffered from corona virus. I wish triple gems blessed you 
We get to choose one person to represent the human race, Im choosing liziqi
Omg that made me cry when she tucked the pup up and she adores her grandmother. She is a very hardworking lady and I wish her only the best

 Good doggySome of the subtitles are copied from the subtitles translated by other people which hasnt been reviewed, so thanks to themLiziqi speaks Sichuan dialect so I couldnt get everything she said, but this is most of it.Im still working on my English, so if there are any improper translations please dont mind, and it would be nice if you point it out so I can learn.
I would love to live like this. Shes an ancient sprit that came back into the world to teach us the true meaning of life.
Maybe shes the younger version of her grandmother, that is how her grandma raised her
it made me sad seeing her rub her wrist whenever it hurt, shes such a hardworking person.
Everyones binge watching Netflix, and Im over here like, Liziqi and chill...
The best thing about her is how she cares and treating her grandmother  the rest isnt precious as much as that

Big like super good night aap bhi I Hamare ghar welcome

Shes the princess I want to be like
She is so talented... I really hope the best for her and I hope she wont catch that horrible Coronavirus spreading around
Inspirasi banget
English Translation of Title Cotton ... Cottons life, I promise to think of a new series name next time hahaha
Who wants her to make a house tour or a farm tourI really love the way she live her life away from the city
I barely do anything yet her hands look better than mine. And I am a teenager...
She and I come from the same place. When I was a child, my neighbor was a shop that made new cotton quilts. A quilt can last for many years and is very warm. My entire childhood was spent watching their magic techniques. They have been doing this for many years. Until today, new technology has taken away the tradition. Few people have made their own cotton into new quilts. The inherited things gradually disappear in the everchanging world. Thank you Ziqi for the touch. She and her lovely grandma remind me of those plain but precious days.
OmgoshThe way she wrapped her dog was so adorable.Shes truly a pure soul and it reflects on everything she does Hats off,lady...The perfectionist of YOUTUBE 
 
Any Indian here I know if any Indian is here like me then it is normal we have seen these all kind of work in real life
Learned information from WEIBO of her assistant that she is OK recently, after some days of busy to collect and delive N mask and other things to hospitals  running out resource in virus battle zone, now she is trying  to make routing life back to normal from work too late in night editing video in last two years, at same time to  take more time taking care grandma, but still work a lot ...,she may return in these days. Thanks.
Im glad that people in this YouTube channel are supporting Liziqi during this virus outbreak in China, after reading hundreds of racism comments towards Chinese virus people on the internet.
From Vit Nam with love
Terus gue apa njirr
Its admirable and while watching, tears started to build up. The part where she fixed it as a bed for her grandma, could no longer hold my tears. And the dog part was like sudden onions thrown my way
Just watching this makes me tired. In a single day she Picked the cotton that she grew herself  which she painstakingly took care of cotton is not an easy plant to growDeseeded it herselfPulled out and fixed...idk what machine that is, but it looks hard as hell to useProceeded to carefully twine the strings around the sticks of the machine all in like a day. Today I got up and was immediately nauseous bc I stoop up too quickly. Truly we are undeserving of such amazing content.
You did a great job , very nice
   , ,  .  ,  .    
 
Dont worry,she lives country side.outbreak in big city.she is more safe than people in London
After watching her channel I admire her hardwork, her willingness to do something until finish, her dedication for doing the all those labor. This also made me realize how great the nature is, for giving us everything we need. Watching her reminding me say thankful to this wonderful modest life, all this time I have been working hard but not to my heart content but for the sake of papers. Wish I can do more of nature labor this year to refresh my mind.
   
It really makes you realise how much cotton it takes to make the clothes and bedding we take for granted every day

Everyone one of u who disliked this video are just jealous because shes smarter and wiser then u Will Ever Be
please add subtitles  
 probably the only best thing I have witnessed on the internet.
To all the people of China my heart and prayers are with you. Be safe, be strong and please make it through this illness.
One way to help her is by not skipping the ads, thats how she earns..the longer ad views the more earnings.
I think about how much she can do and make, and remember Granny was part of teaching her everything she knows and I just get so happy seeing two strong women out here kicking ass on the regular. 
I just cancelled my favourite series movie when I got notification of Liziqi new video 

When liziqi uploads I stop everything and watch it.
make a video of what you cant do
I think I am laziest on the earth
I can tell that shes really skilful when cutting the bamboo, cuz my grandpa used to do that. dont understand those who claim she is acting...
She just made a mattress........a mattress....a whole mattress. Im just useless, I dont even make my bed.
Have no Words to express my feelings for her. Really admire her talent. She can do anything from scratch and does things which brings joy to others.hats off to her
The way she was so gentle with the puppy is preciousShe gave him a new bed without waking him upIncredible, shes like an elf or fairy or something like that with a connection to nature

In a apocalipse scenario, finding her increases my chances of survival by  
Ooo my goodness her heart is pure like a goldshe too takes care muchhh of her pet dog wowwww and her hands starts pain that scene just make me to run and help her out  but i cant really she is both beautiful from inside and outside take care of u so muchh luvvvv
Isnt it just wonderful and heartwarming to see how much she care about those she love Girl.. You are just on another level. Big love
For those people who dislike this, you guys just bitter and jealous cz you cant live such a happy peaceful life like her. Yall trapped in the city and stressed out with your office work
Why some people come to this channel just for tab unlike. Even they dont finish watching the video. How could it be
 
I cant be the only one who likes her hair, they are so silky
I cant help but admire her hard work ethic. She puts so much thought, love and dedication into her videos. People dont realize how hard and how much work goes into this.. Not only making the videos the but the actual work shes doing. You are AMAZING Liziqi.  keep being the beautiful smart and hard working girl that you are. I can see the love and respect you have for your grandmother. Its truly a rarity these days you are a diamond
Ill never forget the time I said she reminds me of a live action studio ghibli character and then the background music you chose for a video was from Spirited Away Made me love this channel that much more
      
the fact that she didnt wake the dog up is sjjsjsjsjdks

Dear Liziqi, thanks a lot for sharing the simplicity but in the same time the beauty and complexity of the ancient Chinese culture. All around your life is so inspirational. Living out of what God has created, every single detail on that rich culinary food. As a idea for future episodes,  it would be awesome if you shows us the way you built the utensils in your kitchen, such as Bowls, baskets, containers, skimmers, etc. please, please just keto doing what you do, I watch your videos in our living room for hours and its just so relaxing. Thanks and thousand thanks
love her video..so inspiring...at least i am in peace when i watch her video and forget about the stressful daily routine..
Eres muy sorprendente, eres una persona unica, especial y dedicada en cada uno de los trabajos que realizas.Gracias por compartir un pedazo de tu mundo y ensearnos que existen personas sencillas y humildes en este mundo.
I love your videos and feel comfortable when l was it you good girl 
A life style many cultures have lost, to live off what the earth provides. I crave a peaceful life like that, teachings of old ways to cultivate and build with your own hands.

She gives so much love through her hard work.
Amazing 
      
queen

I love like grandmother.
She grew her grandma a whole ass blanket
The fact that she made a mattress for her grandma and also her dog but didnt even think of making something for herself  True selflessness 
God this girl is a great
Hats off to this lady
 

anybody else watching her vids out of sheer escapism..like god what a life ,to own a plot of land and farm and make so many things yourself shes really one of the most wonderful content creators
She is just living a simple and great life with mother nature... She is so luckyyyy
Im Chinese        She said with the little dog I will make a quilt for you before the Chinese New Year too,OKWhat a lovely and kind girl
Vous  est  in   expert  AN  tout bravo  felicitari
i appreciate the amount of time they took to make each scene.. it must have took them hours and days to show us these beautiful scenes  meanwhile all i can do and brag is the amount of time me spending watching youtube or her videos 
mantap abiezz


Even if she didnt to everything, so what, she does more than any woman or man I know, its entertainment at doesnt involve hurting someone or shaming someone or laughing at someone in pain, she is showing her culture and techniques that she has learn, what a woman, so humble
The tremendous amount of hardwork she does....is on a whole different level league and little new members to the family
She makes everything possible...theres nothing else that she cant do
Are you okay, Ziqi I am really worried about the virus that is raging on the earth, especially your country. Hope you and your grandma will be fine. I will always support you. Everyone, please send a word of encouragement to her.
this girls intelligence n the things she can create are far beyond me
She even made the doggo a bed TvT this lady is straight out of a Ghibli Film

Shes a great human.When I was little I wanted to do stuff like this. Make my own furniture, bedding, clothing, etc.I wanted to live in a farm with my own family.Its been  years and I still highly admire work like this. Unfortunately I wouldnt be able to live in a farm because I have a high fear of insects and mosquitoes.
In my grand parents village, This cotton beddings craftmans mostly are menShe must be strong then
When her grandmother came over with that jar of something for her wrist because it was hurt....that was the cutest thing

Living like her could be the key to save earth
Even that dog is luckier than me... First time feeling jealous of a dog
The patiences she have is probably what my mom was lecturing about me needing have. 
In a world having an identity crisis, you, dearest Lady, are the definition of how life should be, diligent, hard working, maintaing the old whilst embracing the new, compassionate, strong, exemplary example to the People of Earth. Beauty, intelligence, humility and fortitude. Bravo, Bravo and Blessings of continued Bountifullness. Love defined and refined. 
For the people who say shes an actress, i hope you changed your mind bc she is a REAL  HARD  WORKER 

Shes so pure she even made a blanket for her dog 
Update from her assistantLiziqi is now busy doing spring planting for her farm. Her grandma has old people minor sickness as usual so she will also take care of that and also cooking and watch a little TV with grandma before going to bed. Liziqi has been having a lot of late nite sleep for pass several years because editing video so she want to take opportunity to rest a bit. Her assistant say they knew about us asking for update so perhaps let her rest another half month.Screenshot httpsm.imgur.comgalleryzMtpvFx
    
Mind blowing and magical Making the little dog blanket and covering him so tenderly without waking him was pure love. Nothing short of perfection. I cant stop watching it.
When we talk of women empowerment. I feel this girl nails it. She is truly in all sense empowered.
Protect yourself because there is a high risk of the Corona virus in China nowadays. Also urge your grandmother and those around you to exercise caution many prayers for you
Me at the beginning Omfg shes making mud pies Oh...wait...nevermind..

  

For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son Jesus Christ, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have Eternal Life.  John 
Im not sure I have ever before seen someone with such a tireless and amazing love language as this woman. Every video that comes out, I am astounded by her hardworking yet tender nature, and captivated by the process itself. I have learned so much from her, and we dont even speak the same language. I love it.
woooowwwww

Ch y  gii qu
Meaning of FROM SCRATCH finally found  understood.
I wasnt expecting that she did all that for her grandmother such a selfless sole . Thats true love 
Me cannot even crochet.Her can make a whole mattress from stuff in her backyard.
I cant imagine how ancient Chinese are good at making this kind of stuff wooow.
 .      
I actually think thats the perfect name for a series 
Some times I should say every time I think hows u knows every thingggg u can do anything wow u are Soo amazing and your place is the beautiful place I ever seen
Wonderful to watch. So much dedication and attention to detail. Feels like a rewarding and peaceful way to live. I love the relationships, too.

The life of cotton is still my favorite among all her videos. I keep coming back every hour just to watch this

By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken for dust you and to dust you will return. Genesis   NIV To live a life like this, wow what a great fulfillment.

Thanks for sharing 
 
Great job... She was awesome
Ellerine salk ok gzel emeinize salk ahane yapyorsun hataydan selam olsun
    
This video got copyright I think thats why she replace it with different audio
Inspirational womenhands off to u 
Not everybody have the patience to wait for a plant to bloom and bare fruit to put it on a video, she is really a mesmerizing person.
    
So so youre so so pretty girl
When I saw her picking the cotton one by one, it reminded me of a movie called,  years a slave, in a cotton field, a whole bunch of people were harvesting cotton in that cotton field, Im surprised that it took more than one person to harvest all the cotton, while ziqi does it all by herself, she really is a superhero. It just shows that with time and kindness the same thing can be done with amazing results.
Awww...she made her granny a warm mattress topper and she made a warm blanket for the little dog How sweet is that
If anyone has a desire or wonder why she is the way she is calm, relaxed, peaceful I think you should definitely read Proverb  virtuous wife
    
  ,   

One videos takes more than a year to film cause they have to grow and grow the food and stuff so it must take her so long just to make one video for us
Beautiful girl 

An incredible innovative skills and ideas with fabulous beautiful thats a perfect talent from the human being,so you are one of them... always love and blessings  from INDIA one of the most beautiful country.
    
I wonder if there is anything that she cant do
She is the most skilled person i have ever seen, just mind blowing abilities to do so many things with such a precision its just insane.

Hi from Australia, I am  years old now and i take  care of my  granddaughters,  I grew up in a home like yours ,that is in the  country..a coastal town that is.My Grandparents  taught me a lot also.Some of the things you do is what i did.After living in the city i found i became ill ,my husband left me with the children so i moved to a country town as i knew how to suvive  I still miss the ocean though. I brought up my children  they have moved to the cities i taught them much ,but I now have my teen age granddaughters with me,  and they want  to learn all i can remember as my hands are not as strong now. You have reminded me much i have  forgotten  thank you,and i do love your  cooking, i always loved cooking in a wok and steeming foods the Asian way instead of unhealthy English foods  ,i made rose pettle cordially though ,my grand children loved it .And one said it cured their tummy ach....natural foods  are better for you though it is hard work.Where i live the climate is harsh..droughts and floods.The ground is poor and you cannot grow anything in it so i grow a few things in large tubs....we get by.I look forward to seeing more of your vidios you remind me of happy days in my grandparents home. Many blessings

That was an incredible video Li it brings back memories of my mother she died in ..and how we do that in Samoa but our cotton wool trees are tall you have to climb up and cut down or shake the brunches so that those dried bods can fall off the brunches and inside there are small seeds as well another hard work taking them off..it brought memories of how lazy I was cause I was young and lazy lol..now Im .. i  dragged my feet ...when my mother said that we gonna make some new billows and mattresses..I hated it.but dont show too much.. ah ah...its a long long process..thanks for bringing back those good old memories with my loving mother and two young sisters thank you Li...you look amazing girl in this video...God bless you and your grandma and family 

Me and my daughter have been thinking about you. We hope that you and your grandmother are well. Were also glad that you have all of these survival skills so that it is hopefully easier to stay home until this threat has passed.
She doesnt speak in front of the camera but what She does can reach to our hearts,
Ziqi    

 According to her blog, she injured her nose during this video production when she was splitting bamboo to fix the mattress set.
Dang, homegirl went into grandmas attic and found the old loom , refurbished it and made her a mattress pad to keep grandma and the doggie warm.
I know Im not the only one who got teary eyes when Liziqi wrapped the puppy in his own wittle blanket. All snuggled in  loved 
Some info about Li Ziqi Li Ziqis grandfather was a cook in her village, many of her cooking, woodwork skills etc. were learned from her grandparents. In the initial stage, she did everything alone by herself because she could not affort hiring people. After she became famous she hired an assistant and a videographer to help her.
Shes a master and restorer of all sorts of arts  crafts we want to preserve. Another stunningly beautiful work Thank you as always.
 

imagine to actually live there, just you and ppl that really care for you, away from toxic people. waking up every morning to that incredible view and go to sleep with beautiful night sky....
She melts my heart when she made one for her doggod bless you

She is so quick, efficient and hardworking.

Liziqis comment on bilibili,translated by Google translateAnother Lifetime series Gu Yu started shooting before and after. When I was a kid, I often saw cotton growing hereBut never saw it again when I grew up At that time, there was a big sunbath near the house Near the dam there is almost  acre of cotton Beautiful when blooming White pink flowers swaying in the wind I pretend to see flowers in the cotton field, And pretending to be beautiful  It seems that at least I havent changed   I tried to plant it this year.Worried about variety reasons, I bought several varieties Fortunately, there were buds. I was busy with other delays during the transplant period,Resulting in poor final growth. But fortunately, it is a bit rewarding. Remove the cotton to dry And then deseed When I was a kid, I could find a wood comb for cottonseed. But its gone now So I can only rely on my hands Picking one by one is definitely impossible Think of a way Use a wool comb to comb out cottonseeds It is slower than a carding machine, but also much faster than a hand abstraction.  pounds of cotton for more than half a day Cottonseed and impurities are removed and ready to be pulled This is the cotton net Wrap the spun cotton evenly and densely So I want to pull Pull horizontally and vertically to make a grid, After the large warp pulls the small thread, Pull left and right horizontally Finally, the longitude and latitude of the large line must be fixed. Once the thread is pulled, you can play cotton The tools are about  years old Long time no one used Weathered wood, bamboo strips are almost broken Patch up for a while When chopping bamboo sticks, I was stuck in the nose by flying bamboo sticks Sanding and polishing with new beef tendon strings can also be used Remove cotton seed cotton and loosen it with a stick. Cotton is too dead to bounce off easily More and more tight Playing cotton is really hard work This is not an exaggeration, it is more laborious than letting me carry dozens of catties. When I was a kid, I surrounded my uncle every day to watch him play cotton Havent done it in person, This time I was doing batting for my grandma. I learned it two days in advance. Too strenuous  pounds of wood, And the force of the mallet pulling the tendon string On the basis of this force, we must maintain balance and loosen the cotton. Both hands must work hard to maintain harmony If you can find this old object, you can feel it.


Most people have forgotten how to do these things because of manufacturing and capitalism, where jobs are broken down into smaller and smaller components. Nobody remembers how to make everything you need for life anymore.
She also deserves the highest subscribers among the utubers. Why dont we all give out our best thumbs up and also subscribes her channel by sharing with brothers and sisters if she is willing to shear her knowledge with you and me.

When all the hardworking people from ancient civilizations reincarnates into one body

Protect this person at all cost. She is an inspiration. My bad for discovering her channel at this time only. But bingewatching wont hurt anyway.
With the world in this way I think living like her would be perfect and an example to follow
i died when she made that blanket for the dog. someone do the same for me
        

This girl is really too special for this world... An All in One type of human being 
I like this beautiful girl so much, its not only because she could do everything which we think that its impossible to be finish by a person even a woman, but also i could feel the beauty of eastern civilization from her, every scean and each lanslide in video remind me of how chinese culture is attractive. The most important thing is that many of us have lost us into the fast and new thing from western culture instead of pursing chinese traditional culture and spiritful thing. This video is deserved to recommend to our millennials who have obessed with so much thing from other country like Japan cartoon and anime, Korean Kpop. Lets hope that there are increasing this sort of traditional  promoted chinese culture video

She is such a hard working woman.... Hats offAnd who the hell are those k people.....who disliked the video

                   
you are a beautiful hard womam
.k dislikes Why I dont understand why peoples dislike videos like this such of inspiration also the music is so relaxing can someone whos dislikes this video explain to me why you disliked the video if you have ball replay my comment
I admire this lady on a spiritual level. The sheer resilience, diligence and willpower exudes overwhelms me. I love how wholesome and pure her affection towards her grandmother is. To a certain point Im kind of jealous but that jealousy is what makes me strive to be a better person. I wish I could communicate to my grandmother the same way she does and I wish I could be as hardworking as her. The more videos I watch of this lifestyle the more I start to change those I wish to I will, watching how peaceful life seems there fills me with a sense of determination... but Im still procrastinating doing Science revision
I wanted to thank your great country, China, for helping Italy to overcome this drastic period. Thank you.
It brings tears to my eyes how she takes care of her granny.The people that dislike this must be either very misinformed or just made of stone.
Man, I swear, this is how you live a fulfilling life. I know its not for everyone but if I was given land with a house Id never work a  to  job again.
I would risk the Corona virus for her. P.s if your offended by the mention of Corona and dont have it, sit down and eat some soup
The smile on her grandma face when she sat on the bed was priceless. Such a precious granddaughter
oh to be liziqis dog sleeping peacefully wrapped up in one of her home made blankets
Salute for the patience and effort.Each thing has a story.
My heart melts when she made her granny and her adorable dog a beautiful blankets.. god bless you

Her making and giving the little puppy a blanket was the most wholesome thing Ive ever seen. 
The fact we all like watching her work hard while were in American laying in bed eating hot Cheetos.

I was wondering if she is ok because we havent heard from her for a while Hope she and her grandma are ok 

Is there no one going to talk about his brother love who is always with her and never came on camera . I read about her on Google and get this information when she completed her study and started working for a company... she left job and came back to her village ...never seen such dedication its amazing to see her videos 
OO
  
Making comforter for her grandmother is  warming. She can afford to buy a new one, but this shows love conquers all. Lucky puppy got one too.

me ur.big friend i am bangladasi
I want a friend and life coach or instructor like her. Im willing to learn manual labor for a year. Blessings to you li. May your work and labor be prosperous.


She is cute 
The instrument shes using is also used in most Arabic countries in the past . The guy who make the cotton quilts is called kattan from the word cotton
 Oooo whats she making with the leftovers A pillow Knee Blanketgives dog new blanket with the gentlest of tucksMe, crying profusely OOH
And theres me who just got their plant from school and has died
  
when she sucked that string through a branch i was officially done


I dont know Chinese. Hope you understand my comment here  You are a very special person who helps inspire more motivation to other people in Vietnam, included me. By your videos from the beginning until now, I understand that mother nature is huge and unlimited and being offering too much for the human. We should live close to our natural environment instead of trying to change it in our ways. Love you from Vietnam. 
this woman has better cinematography skills than  of hollywood
 
    
SHE MADE ABED FOR THE DOG IM SO SOFT RN 
she could replace perfect word with her name on dictionary
I felt my hands hurt as she was picking the cotton, I felt so bad for her.
The love she put into what she made for her grandmother and little dog is absolutely beautiful.  


Her granny must be so proud of her as shes carrying her legacy exact the way her granny used to be 
Someone I bet you cant make...Lizi Hold my beer

Advance Happy Chinese New Year to you, to grandma and to your crew. May you be blessed more, pretty princess 
This woman is clearly an empath. Thats why shes so loved and loving.
she is wonderful,she is nice and know everything about nature
That dog at the end is soo cute 
that dogs name is Guogai, her oven is made of herthat dog shaped oven
Shes the most ASTONISHING WOMAN ever. Give her the credit she deserves.
Her grandma looks so proud. That sweet smile was my everything.
               
such an amazing lady.. hope i can live with you.. to experience that kind q of environment and how to be with your grandma..  keep safe always..
                             
One of the most inspirational amazing videos Ive watched in a long time and the  ladys are so beautiful xx
When the grandma passes I bet she will hand craft the coffin and have a beautiful ceremony
only if I can see my grandma smile just one more time like her grandman does
Your videos are eyecatching. Wow.
What a beautiful life, i cry
  
Such a beautiful video. So I want to be there with this girl.
It is my pleasure to see my translation                 ...........   httpsyoutu.becUZUxswLuNwhttpsyoutu.bevEPkrUZZI
Oh gosh i just watched her videos today and im so addicted to it that since morning Ive been watching all her videos and didnt realize that its evening now.. This girl is so hardworking and talented. God bless you dear.
I want to build house like this type of location..This location look like very beautiful and make my mind peacefully.
Looking at those gourds always reminds me of cultivation manhwas lol
I want to live a life like this sooo nature friendly, and soo freshh

Has the music changed I think there were different sounds in the second part of this video. Like usually  some background music, but you could hear what is going on there too. Now it is just piano.  I have seen this video like  times and I think it was different before.
Does your hand have power  when you planted everything why they are growing surely well
And my friends wonder why i obsess over old material hand woven. I used to have a business selling antique and vintage textiles. Now i am retired and must part with some of my collection. I just see how painstaking doing it before machinery was and a labour of love went into it. Even the fancy monograms for the family initials could be beautifully done. I would love for this  lady to have a farm style bed and breakfast, a working holiday to learn her craft. But i am sure is very busy with her life as it is....... she lives a beautiful life
What lady....she knows everything,ably to do anything..
Hi Li Ziqi. Itsbok to name your series with The Life of..., at least we know what the video will be about. Keep safe, to both you and grandma. 
     
Boys saying girls are weakMe how about now
looks so comfy 
She loves her grandma and her dog a lot, I admire her
 .  
when she picked up the little dog and gave it to her grandparent it gave so many memoriesI remember when I lived in Filipeans and has a family of dogs living at my place, the house was close to the beach and u had to climb down a small cliff to get to the beach but the life there was peacefuleverytime I went on vacation with my family some dogs werent there due to death and there was always new dogs I still remember a dog named Koi was theremost of the dogs bite but Koi seems kinda old and peaceful so she would never bite but she had very low healthI hope the next time I visit Filipeans Koi is there
Im at the scene, Im the tool in Li Ziqis hands, come and envy me
I love her lifestyle 
   
She makes her own food for her and her grandmother thats just sweet she puts hard work in to her food
Wooow such an talented youtuber

Fenomenal girls
Shes zero waste in everything she does, everything has its purpose. 

 look at how defined her hands are. They arent dainty or delicate looking. They are rough and well sculptured from hard work. I cant imagine all the calluses she has from doing this.
In the US I was raised in the South where we grow cotton...and I know how hard work it is...this was a lovely video...thank you
 She wounded her nose while splitting the bamboos, according to her Weibo.
  ... 


This woman is wonderful. In addition to being very talented, she is extremely strong and dedicated.
......
Its pretty cool to watch people do things the way the old world did it. For most of the modern societies this is a forgotten skill.
I wonder where is Liqizi now and how is things going with her Dont you guys Ive been visiting her channel  times this week hoping to see her new video. I hope she is doing well Cant wait to see her new beautiful works
Her grandmother is so lucky to have her. She really love her
I hope shes okay and where she lives is not infected with coronavirus   nCoV.
Ziqi Showing how cotton duvet is made from the cotton seeds manually. Me Moved to tear. Amazing.
And here I am being lazy and complaining about my problems. Shes a true inspiration
The most beautiful, talented woman Ive ever seenShe can make anything out of everything..
      .         .   ,  ,  ,       .
Very difficult technique and requires a lot of patient and hard working but the result is beautiful. Great thing to do for grandma. Love her passion and devotion not mention her look , she is a beautiful young lady, inside and outside

Who needs a boy child  This girl literally single handedly holds that place down.Im not sure if its a politically correct  thing to say, but thats what came to my mind.  So excuse me, if I offended anyone.
uses leftover cotton to make the puppy a blanketeverybody liked that

      
Im convinced she has more than  hours in her day
WHEN DOES SHE SLEEP SHE DOES SO MUCH I CANT
FantasticBrilliant
I live with anxiety and panic disorders. I cant describe how relaxing this girls videos are to me. She is amazing.
.
Please be safe in nCOV or any illness People of China.My prayers is with you my Chinese brothers and sisters.PrayerForChina   JIAYOUFrom a Filipino Fan 

I really dont understand how she can make anything she does look so beautiful. Her videos truly bring out the hidden beauty of nature. Aesthetic appeal is so much vivid in her videos that I can watch them over and over again even when I dont understand anything . Lets keep supporting her
Humans sometimes forget how rich we are just with natures gift.
That dog sleeps in a better matress than me
I love all her videos that are winter themed  Its like she ensures she uses her talents to warm others  I love her grandma so much tooI wish we could send them post cards so they know where all their fans come from 
Thank you for caring for her and I can tell you shes fine right now. Because of the virus we have to stay at home and she cant update her video right now.Because shes donating some masks and some money for Wuhan and We are so honored to have such a celebrity in China. So shes fine right now  and you guys dont need to worry about her
 Did anyone notice theres a tiny spot on her nose after she did the woodwork Thats actually a tiny wound. According to her assistants post on Weibo, a scrap of bamboo stroke her nose when she was chopping. Luckily it didnt hit her eye... Better wear goggles next time 

The last few moments with the granny and the pup is just oh my god
So who is happy , when every time she uploads
, , 
This girl who lives in a province has better cam quality than pewdiepie.
cute DAWANG
It almost feels like shes living in heaven. Everything is there. While in city, we are working like slaves and having a shitty polluted life.
 so thats were my chicharones come from. I love tacos de chicharones con salsa verde.

I made the English subtitle, hope you guys like it. BTW, Dianxixiaoge I love you Love from UK but I come from Yunnan Province, too. So I can understand her local dialect. XD

Thank you so much Dianxi, seeing you make this food and learning more about Chinese culturecuisine is amazing. I once told my dad that I would learn how to cook Chinese food, I know, Im a bit crazy but the internet is connecting us all around people like you. I dont look for the negative things, I look for the beautiful things that people do and what you share is wonderful. Keep going. I KNOW I will make this dish one day and itll be because you taught us how. 
After seeing her videos I have decided to change my idea of our new kitchen insted of an modern island kitchen we are going to build a traditional Indian kitchen, there is no point in being with the mainstream it may look good but doesnt feel good, I need a kitchen like this to remember my roots all my great great grannys and their recipies.. thank you so much.
The background music and the whole ambience of where she is working makes it very soothing to look at

There is an observation Id like to expressThe greatest assest in life I think I, obviously money. The greatest liability in life is also money. The later is true as when we get money we dont know what should we do. Well .Food. Travel. Get educated. All simultaneously. Thats what money should be used for only. Because all the three ends are rewarding. More rewarding that humans in general .
The music, endless  pork fat drenched..the triangle hat, pounding vegetables, perfection

Whoever marries this woman is a lucky man.
I love that she goes and picks fresh vegetables. It makes the food look even better.

    .          .  



Feel so impressed when I see the food from my hometown in YouTube.

Omg this made my mouth water from start to end
  
Something about this all feels so pure and nostalgic, even though its so radically different from my own life. Im envious of the ability to go on a walk through the countryside for fresh vegetables, cooking for a whole family and seeming so content and at peace. Love your videos, and thank you for this look into another way of life.
So calming and soothing. I want to achieve this level of emotional comfort.
This is absolutely incredible. Age old skills many of us in the western world have lost making us vulnerable and unable to store food in traditional ways
    
nice way of preserving food,thank you for sharing this.
She made the god damn grease can I get  a moment of silence.
 
            
Bruh I need an asmr version without the music
Saluti dallItalia. Bravissima

Parabns pelo vdeo. Interessante  descobrir que culturas to distantes compartilham os mesmas tcnicas. Aqui no Brasil Minas Gerais a arte de conservar a carne suna na gordura  chamada de carne na lata.
Did somebody time travel to the past and shoot this video Its weird seeing such rural lifestyle and cooking with such amazing videography...
Video perfecto para ver a la madrugada cuando el cielo gira
In Mexico we call that Carnitas
Love it

I really like your food you make

Hey you looks so fresh eventhough you work in hot kitchen.... yOU SHOULD DO a video revealing your beauty secrets .....I really like your videos .......I have become a huge fan of yours  ......Please respond.........
Youre so beautiful and a perfectionist too

We call that CARNITAS AND CHICHARON in MEXICO 
I never a knew a pork belly video could be so peaceful and soothing
The food that you share is very delicious and interesting. Thank you for everything
Such harmony from first second to last......I dont think Ill ever experience that sense of farm to table bliss.
She must be some cousins or relatives to liziqi or at least neighbors
The cat just throw my focus off XD
  
I love you work, Im from El Salvador,  excellent

Looks great, the culture and style of cooking Im a big fan of.
so she uses VPN How did she defeat the great firewall of china

For some reason, her twisting that cabbage out of the ground felt more violent than all the meat chop she was doing.
Can I come over. Id never go home after eating. Id chain myself to the front door
Super duper..
Whatever she cook, it looks good, delicious, effortless  clean.
    ....  ...        ...
With great cooking like these, Asian kids will have no trouble eating their veggies. Eating disorders must be rare in China, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and the rest of Asia where good home cooking still prevails.
Im still thinking about how to describe your art
    

Im so glad this has English subtitles. Also I love the music, classical is my favorite
What a wholesome looking way to live
As if Im watching an emotional cooking movie... The sound, and the editing, the character, the pasion
Every single video calms the Mind in a serious beautiful way
   ,   ,   .         

The way of living you show us is so precious. Not even Gordon Ramsay could complain^^
The simple beauty of this woman working in harmony with everything around her touches my soul
  .  
Why Im watching this with empty stomach
            ...
This was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.Can I come live at the farm Please, I am respectful and strong, so I can work. Ill make my own home on the outskirts of village, I will not be a problem.Please, please.

Your family is so lucky to have you.  All your cooking looks delicious.  Wish I could smell and taste it  Thanks for sharing your fabulous cooking abilities.

A gorgeous woman, fantastic food, absolutely beautiful place what more could a man ask for.....I would marry her and live there in an instant, even though I wouldnt understand the language I wouldnt care I would learn the language.
When I was  my uncle Solano butchered a pig, and set it on a spit that was part of there kitchen, my aunt made hot mexican chocolate with cinommon stick slowly in a clay pot hung at a smaller spit hook. It was christmas , the odor of pig roasting over slowly and the chocolate, as it thickened.  Made me feel like I was special. Best meal ever....
Dianxi and Liziki are my two favorite YouTube channels

Wow, chinese foods are sure tasty and nice decorated. Would love to try Chinese cuisine 
Damn that pork was cooked to death, brought back to life, and cooked again.
Such cooking skills with a great deal of pride, reminds me of the women in my country, we cook the same...love to see the way these women cook without a fuss but a choice to eat what they have...bless her... 
I saw this and I say oh I wanna try this, it must be delicious
No entiendo nada pero eres genial... XDSaludos desde Venezuela...  
When she cut that pork at the end my stomach started growling hard lol
    
If you were a bed and breakfast, how lovely life could be.

That cat only appears once every blue moon 
Your living an awesome life. Keep it up. You can get everything fresh, having high quality food.
I, too, have a  wok at home
Watching videos like these reminds me that happiness is found in simplicity too. For many, its the most fulfilling kind of happiness. Taking care of a land, enjoying the fruits of your labour, being in tune with nature, sharing moments with your family. The fewer things you need to be happy, the happier you find yourself to be.
I like how whatever you need you take from the field and go
It has been a long time since everyone in the family sat around the table and had a dinner. I miss that time.

I do love the your village. I wish I own a farm in your village. It looks beautiful and peaceful
All that effort and working in the kitchen, as of me.. Cooking a simple dish takes about hour. She made it look so easy to prepare.
    ...
Linda arte de cozinhar.Meus parabns daqui do Brasil

Despite the place and the Beautiful music and the lovely dog and the cute cat I found this video disgusting .
I love how they eat together in the end it makes my heart melt
Que delcia. Parabns.

Apart from cooking one another thing I really admire is the Family fond.As an Indian we are proud of having joint families ,three or more generations living together,respect for elders,love for each other.Thats the cultural identity common in both civilisation Chinese and Indian.The woman is sweet and adorable and her cooking skills are of high standards.
My cardiologist just fired me for watching this.
   
Liziqi and Dianxi both great vloggers and from chinaWISHING Philippines is just like China simple and peace

Her meowing back at a cat was hilarious
Just watched ur videos from the greeny island SrilankaLove your videos muchIm also doing cooking videos but in the forest in Srilankan traditioanl style and with the rhythm of the nature.
why in the hell im watching this smh
Do you remember the taste of refining lard to make oilbased meat when you were young Oil bottom meat, we call it braised meat locally. A long time ago, the ancestors invented this method of storing pork in order to prevent the pork from rotting and spoiling, and later it became a particularly delicious dish
Wow thanks for the techniques of preserving food we love chinese foods ,we also cook it in the philippines as our traditional foods especially noodles..
They say, heaven is a place on earth... Probably, this is it...
It s amazing. I want to try it.
Fresh all ingredients and no artificial flavor 
Parabns  voc  uma excelente cozinheira 
Wish can cook with this calm situation

I feel taking a one little short yummy journey. so comfortable feeling all the time. it would be great inspiring subject to me to draw cook life with touching stories.  
I really loved that dog 

You seem so down to earth, unpretentious, and your personality is so cute I also enjoy seeing you with your gorgeous, massive dog. Its clear that you love each other and that you take good care of him. I think for these reasons your channel is my favorite one of this type although I do enjoy the others too but it is a different mood. Im ChineseAmerican. My dad speaks your dialect. Unfortunately, I only speak Cantonese so I hope someone can translate.
The music reminds me of something I dont want to remember.
       .    .  .  
Im wondering how you clean that large pan or pot something
A ver si tenemos un poquito mas de respecto a la vida de los animales,que tienes a los  cerds y otros encerrados en una mierda de un metro por un metro, y otras Cosas que me voy a callar,en fin .Asc puro.
Hello 
Thomas.also a coolerli festyle
   


I love the way she prepared everything. The end was so lovely serving her family outside. Looks like Paradise. Keep up the great cooking.
i watch this and I feel like Im betraying Liziqi who started this kind of videos.
My grandparents would preserve pork liks this in Romania since they didnt have a fridge , it was the best thing ever . People in the countryside still do it to this day and in winter you can find it in some of the shops
The music in this video is of great value as a lullaby.
  ^^
    
 
vs Grandpa kitchenTwo asian superpowers war about cookingvsI cheer for both of allTwo countries are both famous for gourmet.

Iam preethi like u ur food vry nice god bless u
    
Honestly, I am impressed with their cuisine, for those of us who are not from their culture, particularly I am very impressed and it is very interesting, their sauces, vegetables, meats in their different flavors, I think they are fresh, smoked or in the form of bacon , if Im not mistaken. I had the great opportunity to get to know oriental food in my country, Peru, of course not as intense as you do. I must congratulate on your videos, it is inspirational, I wish you good luck, Miss or Mrs Dianxi.

Hello... Indonesia mana nih Bukan krn apa yg dimasak tapi vidio yg disajikan, natural, alami, alat yg digunakan traditional sangat jarang dijumpai dijaman serba modern skr selalu sukaaaaa liatin vidionya
in lebanon  we call it AWARMA but were not using pork, just lamb or beef
Im my thirty years of existence I never knew that theres a hairy tofu.
Que hermoso todo lo q haces es todo artesanal sabes as hacemos las cosas tambin en Mxico saludos desde Guanajuato Mxico
          
I love hairy tofu a lot. I miss it and I dont know where I could find and buy in Thailand.
Looks like the best cotton candy ever. Yum. Im going to look in my local grocery stores.
I like the way you film your video but Icant eat this things
I came here like hairy tofu. hell no but after watching I admit I really want to try your cooking. Looks incredible.
The comment section looks so updated that I taught it was a new video lol
if that tofu is alive ,id love to have one as a pet...ITS SO CUTE 
Im so high I thought they were little baby chickens 
i love you videos
Give some of that Tofu fur to my Bald sphynx kitty
I dont even know what Tofu is, nevermind a hairy variant.
yall are scared of mold but still eat mushrooms
Its amazing, if I had a chance to eat this, I wanna try to eat There is so many effort for making this tofu
It was recommended but It was worth it..but wait is hairy food does itChinese people Yes we make everything
Well, that moldy tofu looks delicious I gotta try some.
In fact, this is a superb food processing method. Soy protein is decomposed by mold to obtain more flavorful amino acids, which is more conducive to human digestion and absorption.
I only eat that hairy tofu if she cook it fir me.
     ,    ,    .
Estoy encantada con las recetas mostradas,  pero me gustara... que se traduzca los ingredientes utilizados. Felicito toda la forma y herramientas artesanales para cocinar 
     
Im Chinese and I didnt even know hairy tofu is a thing
I thought they were hamsters in the thumbnail
Nobody notices the great camera work and editing Kudos to the people behind these amazing videos
Just imagine getting a piece of fur or hair stuck in that, then eating it.  its too fuzzy for me 
Sla, s sei que o youtube me recomendou kkkkk. Satisfatrio assistir eles fazerem isso
I felt for a moment that hairy tofu looked censored
If my tofu looks like this, i would NEVER eat that OO  but i like this kinde of videos
Immediate reaction  THATS MOLD
You are really an inspirational personYou remind me of my home sures when I was back home. Good bless you and bless your work.
WHEN I SEE TOFU I ALWAYS REMEMBER KIM DAHYUN
What I thought I was making when I mixed all the shampoos in the shower
Idk if Im being weird or something but those hairy tofu look so cute
This is a form of tofu I have never seen before, so interesting.

Man, and I thought I was sufficient with my protein intake dayum I want that
Where I am from, when i start to see the hairy stuff on food or anything I throw them away. So do everyone else.
I have this weird urge to keep one of those tofus as a pet...
Id like to know what the season g she used at the end of the video was, looks like those tofu pieces were fermented in that big jar.
It kinda reminds me of cotten candy though Im sure it doesnt taste like it XD. I am curious about what is happening . Is it a mold or something Or just how tofo reacts over time. I have no idea.  Though its probably on my list of things to try at one point. 
Relaxing moment in my life
  
love you so much keep work, fans for indonesia
I somehow managed to read the title as there are several ways of eating h a i r after seeing the thumbnail cuz i never knew this thing existed
I thought she was holding and feeding bunnies LOL
most of you said I cant eat this  Although it is their tradition But what about cheese  It is also a bacteria that takes a long time  but the tofu was left overnight and the fire was on
   ..
The first time i came to know about this tofu is from a hong kong movie. I wondered how it taste ever since.
Cant stop watching this even after a year the tofu looks so cute and fluffy and I am drooling it must tastes good
I love how you always make tofu from scratch. 
Damn I never know it exist but it looks so good. It was so properly done in a very clean environment. I love the way you film your video too
They shouldve named it cotton tofu it sounds more appetizing than hairy tofu
No one Literally no oneMe  I dont even know what Tofu is  But it looks tasty PS OMG I got  likes  thank you all for these likes.... Im very happy 
The ending is so good I want that pot 
Still dont know what happen to the tofu cube, like when this hairy thing came from
Lots of love  Stay Safe Take Care Stay Healthy all Family
I thought those were baby chickens at first 

me just looking at the thumbnail not minding the contents title wait are those chicksme reading the vlogs title oh, a tofu. wait a hairy one
   ..... .. .......
I thought it was hamster in the first place before entering.
    ...        
So relaxing 
Watching from Dhaka, Bangladesh .Love for Chinese Brother  Sister from Bangladesh.
There is truely an art to all of this and ALOT of hard work....well done 
I just love your presentation Thank you
Everything looks easy on YOUTUBE but in reality this life style is extremely hard.  If you have to think about the processes.  I hope you know that it took a few days and lots of work.


  ,    
I want to know who first looked at mouldy tofu and went Im gonna eat this

Are you sure that it was edible. It looked like it had fungus on its surface 
     ... 
I didnt knew she get millions of views. Such a hard working and gorgeous woman deserves viewership and praise.
Many people making comments on hairy tofu.. its their cultural food.. we should not comment on it... cheese is also bacterial activity equivalent to fungus.. but we love eating it ..
I feel like theres just a small community of these fairies that live somewhere in the mountains, self sufficient, and multitalented with the most aesthetic shots and perfect editing, making things youve only dreamt you had the motivation, talent, and patience to do.
Several ways of eating whAT
  ,       
So amazing place to live..Fresh air and a great family i really want to live in a village like you because in the big city i cant see mountain or big tree all i can see is dust and smoke..Say hi for your family love from bali.
A lot of effort to make tofu. Yet we buy it so cheap.
     
Estou amando o canal dela Realmente  de uma simplicidade e alm disso te acalma, sem falar que ela cozinhando  lindo. Agrada os olhos da gente 
I watched and was struck by how privileged I am. I just drive to a grocery store and buy food as needed. Refrigeration and Freezing food. Very sobering watching the long process from harvesting to table. Thats true labor.
Sis makes me want to live on the mountains and build a farm
I get hairy bread when Ive left it in the cupboard and forgot about it...
Youtube algorithm someway got me into this now i want to eat tofu
         .    .             .
... 
Wha... I thought it was bunnies in the thumbnail...
Wax it before eating.Men already know that.
Im a Filipino working here in Heilongjiang, China. Ive never seen this here but its worth trying There is a lot of Chinese food that doesnt look good but tastes awesome 
                              
I though on the thumbnail were baby chickens I am confiusion
    
over here that hairy tofu wouldve been consider expired 
When tofu hits puberty
Your video is good but not as much liziqi... its just an amazing i like to watch liziqi more
    ...         .
Tofu has hairsMeanwhile my bald head shine bright like the diamonds in the sky.
Just gonna assume that the hair is a type of mold
Who else thought they were baby chickens in the thumbnail.
Im kinda grateful that I dont have to put this much effort into making food because if I did, my lazy ass would be starving.

i really want to taste this hairy tofu and am totally disgusted at the same time...

The beauty of it is that she made everything from scratch. From farm to food on the tabl. An art in itself

i feel transported to a different world when i watch these videos

       
When it said hairy tofu my biomed degree immediately SCREAMED

                 
When i saw how much time and knowledge its need..iam glad i have kfc next to my home
 
   ...       ...
I clicked on this cause I thought they were kittens.
So the hair is mold, right Or could it be something else
This is so much better than watching two dudes build a pool in the middle of the woods
people in the comment is talking about how they wouldnt eat a mouldy tofu, but its the same thing like cheese or beer. It all goes through the process of fermentation. I think this tofu is delicious and everyone should try it. Its really creamy.
The bigger question here is what does it even taste like  Im so curious
Theres other Chinese girl named Liziqi who did the same thing...her cooking skills was amazing
For some reason i thought she was eating a hamster
One of the ways is to not eat it at all 
No one.....literally no onePhilippine vendors TahOoOoooOoooOoOOo
To be honest if your saying hairy tofu is disgusting then I would like to say its on the same level of cheese and beer.

soay beans milk processed so fungus will grow massively so then they can eat them in the winter . thats brilliant and u people still eat mashroms Dah
 
YouTube a year later Here you go
I remember my grandma and grandpa, seeing how you made the food, and the way you smoothen the soybeans using that tool steering stone really like my grandmas..at their hometown, long time ago, i remember them, but now is gone, as like they are gone to heaven, thank you to reminds me and keeping me more and more in love with them and forgive them
     
people nowadays dont realise how important it is to eat fermented food like stinky tofu or the furry fungal tofu here. or even kimchi or sauerkraut  Theyre amazing for your digestion
I thought it was a bunch of headless chicks
I am sitting , in my house watching all your videos eating a bag of walkers crisps beef n onion flavour lol dear me I wonder what shall I cook f tea. Lol wish  I was in your house what great food  you cook .best wishes from England UK

That fried hairy tofu looked delicious though.
 It loses its fluffiness going through the further recipes.. I thought the hair was firm by looking at the thumbnail photo lmaoBtw I agree with calling that fluffy tofu, not hair tofu. But I think its because the idea Asian people have about the word hair  is not that disgusting..I mean, if I showed my mom the name and the actual hair tofu, she would rather think its hilarious cos the tofu has denser hair than my dad And she wouldnt feel that disgusted thinking of animal hair that has dandruff or dirts on it..
amag yan sis
      ...  ...   
Yes that is fungus.
Lol when it showed the tofu being ready, I thought I was losing wifi connection.

My cousins reaction to seeing a harry tofu THATS FKIN MOLDY
Is it fungus which is grown on those cubes
I like your cooking very much. 

My adventurous side says  oh yeah . My normal American side say  are you just cooking moldy tofu  Either way I would eat it if you invited me for dinner. Now Im curious.
Hairy tofu is very taste. Someone might want to know why it is hairy. It is because of the bacteria. But this is a benificial bacterial, which transfers the tofu to be more tasty.To make fermented Tofu, it has a similar process. Normally, tofu has a very plain taste. But after this transformation, it tastes really good.
seeing how passionate the girl is making the hairy tofu is very wholesome
I discovered hairy tofu at  JOKES ON YALL
I wanna try this Actually im a fan of tofu but its first time ive watch hairy tofu I wanna know the taste

Helal olsun sana  
    
I thought it was some sort of small fluffy animals in the thumbnail
                   
So basically its moldy tofu
   

Que es eso y porqu youtube me lo recomienda
This was recommended to me after watching a banana time lapse of its rotting process. Same fuzzy white stuff.
  .    
Tha hairy tofu.. looking  like  a hen childrens but very interesting  recipe..with the hard work...
Oh my god. Liziqi is not alone. Yeeeey
Ae vn s ti y sm thi
  
Looking tasty
      
   
   
 
Damn that aint hairy thats mold
Everything was so cool to watch.  Im not trying to be negative in any way, I am just genuinely curious if the hair is actually mold. If it is mold, then is it safe to actually be eating. Is it like a nontoxic type of mold Ohhhhh did you expose it to sunlight to kill the bacteria.
    
Nature is paradise.
   
     
       



Olum tofu lan bu
You are very hard working

No wonder why you have so much subscribers, this video is quiet calm and relaxing to watch. I also love how you use youre own creativity.

I have only heard of stinky tofu so this is a first for me. I feel somewhat scared of the idea of something wt a giant hairy mold on it but its not too disimilar to eating other fermented food like tempe or blue cheese.
